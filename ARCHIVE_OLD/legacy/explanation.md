### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Single Entry Point**: "read claude.md" triggers the entire system
2. **Automatic Activation**: No manual agent selection required
3. **Hierarchical Coordination**: Context-manager delegates to appropriate specialists
4. **Shared Context**: All agents access the same project information
5. **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Built-in retry logic and error handling

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the CLAUDE.md File

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root with the following structure:

```markdown
# 🚨 CRITICAL SESSION STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS - AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION 🚨

## MOST CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - AUTOMATIC PROJECT MANAGEMENT SETUP

### WHEN USER SAYS "read claude.md" OR "read CLAUDE.md" - EXECUTE THIS SEQUENCE:

[Include the complete activation sequence from the template below]
```

### Step 2: Define Project-Specific Context

Add your project information to CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - READ FIRST

[Define your project-specific rules and standards]

# [Your Project Name] Development Notes

## Current Project State
[Document current status, tech stack, deployment info, etc.]
```

### Step 3: Configure Agent System Access

Ensure your Claude Code instance has access to:
- Task tool for agent activation
- Read tool for file access
- Standard development tools (Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)

### Step 4: Test the Activation

1. Start a new Claude Code session
2. Type: "read claude.md"
3. Verify the following sequence occurs:
   - Claude Code reads the CLAUDE.md file
   - Project context is extracted and summarised
   - Context-manager is activated via Task tool
   - Context-manager confirms activation
   - Session leadership transfers to context-manager

### Step 5: Validate System Operation

Confirm successful setup by checking:
- ✅ Context-manager acknowledges project leadership
- ✅ Project state summary is accurate
- ✅ Development rules are acknowledged
- ✅ Subsequent requests go through context-manager
- ✅ Specialist agents are coordinated appropriately

## CLAUDE.md Template and Configuration

### Universal CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# 🚨 CRITICAL SESSION STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS - AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION 🚨

## MOST CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - AUTOMATIC PROJECT MANAGEMENT SETUP

### WHEN USER SAYS "read claude.md" OR "read CLAUDE.md" - EXECUTE THIS SEQUENCE:

**STEP 1: IMMEDIATELY READ CLAUDE.MD FILE**
\`\`\`
Use Read tool to read: /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
\`\`\`

**STEP 2: EXTRACT ALL SESSION CONTEXT**
- Parse all project context, current status, and development notes
- Understand the complete project scope and current state
- Identify current priorities and any blockers
- Review technical architecture and deployment status

**STEP 3: AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATE CONTEXT MANAGER**
\`\`\`
Use Task tool with these exact parameters:
Tool: Task
Agent: context-manager
Description: "Activate context-manager for [Your Project] session leadership"
\`\`\`

**MANDATORY Context-manager prompt template:**
\`\`\`
CONTEXT-MANAGER ACTIVATION - [YOUR PROJECT NAME]

I have successfully read the complete CLAUDE.md file and extracted all project context. You are now designated as the project lead and context manager for this development session.

CURRENT PROJECT STATE SUMMARY:
• Project: [Your project name and description]
• Tech Stack: [Your technology stack]
• Deployment: [Your deployment status and infrastructure]
• Current Status: [Current development phase and priorities]

CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES IN EFFECT:
[Your project-specific rules]

CONTEXT-MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. IMMEDIATELY confirm you are taking project leadership of this session
2. Coordinate ALL subsequent tasks by selecting appropriate specialist agents
3. Maintain awareness of complete project scope and current state
4. Ensure all development follows critical rules and standards
5. Manage task delegation and progress tracking for all user requests

Please confirm your activation and readiness to manage this development session.
\`\`\`

**STEP 4: VERIFY CONTEXT-MANAGER ACTIVATION**
- Wait for context-manager to explicitly confirm activation
- Verify acknowledgement of project state and rules
- Confirm readiness to coordinate tasks
- If no confirmation, RETRY Step 3 once

**STEP 5: COMPLETE HANDOFF TO CONTEXT MANAGER**
- Context-manager takes project leadership role
- All subsequent tasks go through context-manager
- Original Claude Code assistant steps back

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Project Context Section**: Include comprehensive project state
2. **Development Rules**: Define clear, enforceable standards
3. **Technical Details**: Document architecture, APIs, and infrastructure
4. **Status Updates**: Maintain current deployment and development status
5. **Authentication Details**: Include test accounts and access information

## Agent System Integration

### Understanding the Task Tool

The Task tool enables activation of specialist agents:

```
Tool: Task
Agent: [agent-name]
Description: "[Clear description of what the agent should do]"
```

### Available Specialist Agents

Context-manager can coordinate these specialist agents:

**Development Agents**:
- `frontend-engineer`: React, Next.js, UI development
- `backend-engineer`: API development, server logic
- `database-admin`: Database design and optimisation
- `devops-engineer`: Deployment and infrastructure

**Quality Assurance Agents**:
- `qa-engineer`: Testing and quality assurance
- `security-analyst`: Security review and implementation
- `performance-engineer`: Performance optimisation

**Specialised Agents**:
- `api-designer`: API architecture and design
- `ui-designer`: User interface design
- `data-scientist`: Data analysis and ML implementation
- `mobile-developer`: Mobile app development

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Single Agent Tasks**: Direct delegation to one specialist
2. **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Coordinated efforts across multiple agents
3. **Sequential Processing**: Agents work in specific order
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
