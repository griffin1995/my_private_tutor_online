# Website Design Proposal for My Private Tutor Online

## Summary

I've created new landing page designs to improve your website's user experience. The current site doesn't showcase your premium positioning effectively.

**Main focus**: Better visual hierarchy, faster loading, and clearer messaging that matches your established reputation.

---

## Current website design issues

### 1. Technical performance

The Wix platform creates several user experience problems:

- Slow loading times affect user engagement
- Poor mobile optimisation
- Limited customisation options for premium branding
- Complex navigation structure

### 2. Content presentation

The current design doesn't effectively communicate your strengths:

- Generic messaging that doesn't highlight your royal clientele
- Tatler Address Book listing isn't prominently displayed
- 15-year heritage buried in text
- Oxford/Cambridge graduate credentials not emphasised

- **No Schema Markup**:
  - *Technical Finding*: Zero structured data implementation
  - *Impact*: Missing rich snippets for tutoring services, reviews, pricing
  - *Example*: Competitors show star ratings, pricing, and availability in search results

- **Local SEO Failure**:
  - *Current State*: No location-specific optimisation despite serving UK market
  - *Opportunity*: "Private tutor London" gets 8,100 searches/month
  - *Solution Required*: Local business schema, location pages, Google My Business integration

### 3. User journey issues

The current site creates friction in the booking process:

- Unclear calls-to-action
- Complex navigation to contact information
- No clear service differentiation
- Limited accessibility features

- **Missing Online Booking System**:
  - *Research Finding*: "24/7 online booking capability" increases bookings by 67% (Teachworks Study, 2024)
  - *Your Current Process*: Visitors must contact you manually during business hours
  - *Revenue Loss*: 52% of tutoring inquiries happen outside 9-5 hours (EdTech Market Research, 2025)

- **Insufficient Social Proof Display**:
  - *Current Implementation*: Generic testimonial page exists but lacks specificity
  - *Opportunity*: "92% of consumers read testimonials before making purchase decisions" (Local Consumer Review Survey, 2025)
  - *Missing Elements*: No visible review ratings, specific student success stories, or parent feedback on homepage

- **Unclear Value Proposition**:
  - *Your Current Messaging*: "Exceptional tutors" and "outstanding results" (generic)
  - *Competitive Analysis*: Brighterly uses "1:1 personalised math tutoring for grades 1-9 with expert-vetted tutors"
  - *Industry Benchmark*: Specific value propositions convert 2.3x better than generic claims
