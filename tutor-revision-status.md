# Tutor Card Revision Status Document
**Last Updated:** August 29, 2025
**Project:** My Private Tutor Online - Tutor Card Enhancement System
**Current Phase:** Step 2 - Animation Implementation (Partially Complete)

---

## üìä Executive Summary

We are implementing a sophisticated tutor card expansion system using Radix UI Accordion with coordinated animations. Step 1 (Context Provider) is complete and working perfectly. Step 2 (Accordion with animations) is functionally working but missing proper collapse/expand animations that match Radix's native behavior.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Context Provider Implementation [COMPLETED]

### What Was Accomplished
- Created `TutorCardsProvider` context for coordinated card state management
- Implemented single active card tracking across all tutor cards
- Wrapped page component with provider for global state access
- Ensured clean state transitions when switching between cards

### Files Modified
- `/app/our-tutors/page.tsx` - Added TutorCardsProvider wrapper
- `/components/tutors/TutorCardsContext.tsx` - New context provider file

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Context provides:
- activeCard: string | null - Currently expanded card ID
- setActiveCard: (id: string | null) => void - State setter
```

### Status: ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING
- Context properly manages single active card state
- Clicking different cards correctly switches active state
- Clicking same card properly toggles closed

## üü° Step 2: Radix Accordion + Width Animation [PARTIALLY WORKING]

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Radix Accordion integration complete
- ‚úÖ Cards expand to full width (1400px) when opened
- ‚úÖ Width expansion happens via CSS transition
- ‚úÖ Proper coordination between cards (only one open at a time)
- ‚úÖ Content structure maintained with AccordionTrigger and AccordionContent

### What's NOT Working
- ‚ùå Missing Radix's native height collapse/expand animation
- ‚ùå AccordionContent appears/disappears instantly instead of animating
- ‚ùå Need to combine BOTH height animation (Radix native) AND width animation (custom)

### Current Technical Approach
```css
/* Current CSS in TutorCard.module.css */
.card {
  transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.13, 1);
}

.expanded {
  width: 1400px !important;
  max-width: 1400px !important;
}
```

### The Problem
The Radix Accordion's native animation for AccordionContent (the smooth height expansion/collapse) is not working. The content just appears/disappears instantly. We need:
1. Radix's default accordion animation (height)
2. PLUS our custom width expansion animation
3. Both animations synchronized with same timing/easing

### Files Modified
- `/components/tutors/TutorCard.tsx` - Converted to Radix Accordion
- `/components/tutors/TutorCard.module.css` - Added width transition styles

---

## üîß Current Technical State

### Component Structure
```typescript
// TutorCard.tsx current structure:
<Accordion.Root type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion.Item value={tutor.id}>
    <div className={`${styles.card} ${isExpanded ? styles.expanded : ''}`}>
      <Accordion.Trigger>
        {/* Header content */}
      </Accordion.Trigger>
      <Accordion.Content>
        {/* Expanded content */}
      </Accordion.Content>
    </div>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Animation Requirements
- **Height Animation:** Should use Radix's native accordion behavior
- **Width Animation:** Should expand from 380px to 1400px
- **Timing:** Both should use same easing curve (cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.13, 1))
- **Duration:** 300ms for smooth, coordinated animation

---

## üö® Critical Issue to Fix

### The Animation Problem
**Current Behavior:** Width animates correctly, but AccordionContent just pops in/out
**Required Behavior:** Both height AND width should animate smoothly together

### Potential Solutions to Investigate
1. Check if Radix Accordion CSS is being properly imported
2. Verify no CSS conflicts are overriding Radix animations
3. May need to add explicit animation styles to AccordionContent
4. Could require data-state attributes for animation triggers

### Animation CSS That May Be Missing
```css
/* Radix typically uses these data attributes */
[data-state="open"] {
  animation: slideDown 300ms cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.13, 1);
}

[data-state="closed"] {
  animation: slideUp 300ms cubic-bezier(0.87, 0, 0.13, 1);
}

@keyframes slideDown {
  from { height: 0; }
  to { height: var(--radix-accordion-content-height); }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from { height: var(--radix-accordion-content-height); }
  to { height: 0; }
}
```

## üìã Complete Roadmap Status

### Step 1: Context Provider ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Global state management for active card
- Single card expansion coordination
- Clean state transitions

### Step 2: Radix Accordion Implementation üü° 70% COMPLETE
**Working:**
- Radix Accordion structure
- Width expansion animation
- Proper trigger/content separation

**Needs Fixing:**
- Radix native height animations not working
- Need smooth collapse/expand for AccordionContent
- Synchronize height and width animations

### Step 3: Sibling Fade Effects ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
- Fade non-active cards to 0.6 opacity
- Only when a card is expanded
- Smooth opacity transitions
- Maintain hover states appropriately

### Step 4: Radix Separator Integration ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
- Add separators between collapsed cards
- Hide separators when cards expand
- Use Radix Separator component
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### Step 5: Final Polish & Extras ‚è≥ NOT STARTED
- Enhanced animations and micro-interactions
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility enhancements
- Mobile responsive behavior
- Final visual refinements

## üìÇ Key Files Reference

### Core Components
1. `/components/tutors/TutorCard.tsx` - Main card component (needs animation fix)
2. `/components/tutors/TutorCard.module.css` - Card styles (has width animation)
3. `/components/tutors/TutorCardsContext.tsx` - Context provider (complete)
4. `/app/our-tutors/page.tsx` - Page with provider wrapper (complete)

### Current State of TutorCard.tsx
- Uses Radix Accordion.Root, Item, Trigger, and Content
- Has context integration for active state
- Width animation working via CSS classes
- Missing proper height animation for content

---

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Radix Accordion Animations
1. Debug why Radix native animations aren't working
2. Check CSS imports and potential conflicts
3. Add necessary animation keyframes if missing
4. Test with explicit data-state styling
5. Ensure both height and width animate together

### Priority 2: Complete Step 2
1. Verify animations work in both directions (expand/collapse)
2. Test with different content sizes
3. Ensure smooth coordination between cards
4. Polish timing and easing curves

### Priority 3: Implement Step 3 (Sibling Fades)
1. Add opacity transitions to non-active cards
2. Use context to determine fade state
3. Maintain proper hover interactions
4. Test visual hierarchy

## üí° Context for Future Sessions

### Current Working State
- The tutor cards ARE expanding to full width
- The Radix Accordion IS functioning (open/close logic works)
- The Context Provider IS coordinating cards properly
- The ONLY issue is missing collapse/expand animations

### The User's Expectation
User wants to see:
1. The EXACT animation that Radix Accordion uses by default (smooth height animation)
2. PLUS the width expansion we've added
3. Both animations happening simultaneously with same timing

### Technical Debugging Notes
- Check if `@radix-ui/react-accordion` CSS is being imported
- Verify no global styles are setting `transition: none` on accordion elements
- May need to explicitly import Radix animation styles
- Could be a CSS module scoping issue preventing Radix animations

### Testing Approach
1. First: Get Radix height animation working alone
2. Then: Ensure width animation still works
3. Finally: Synchronize both animations perfectly

---

## üîç Investigation Checklist

When resuming this work:
- [ ] Check browser DevTools for animation styles on AccordionContent
- [ ] Look for `data-state` attributes on Radix elements
- [ ] Verify no CSS conflicts with `height: auto` or `overflow: hidden`
- [ ] Test with inline styles to isolate issue
- [ ] Check if Radix CSS variables are being set (`--radix-accordion-content-height`)
- [ ] Review Radix Accordion documentation for animation requirements
- [ ] Test in different browsers to rule out browser-specific issues

---

## üìå Success Criteria

The implementation will be complete when:
1. ‚úÖ Cards expand both height AND width smoothly
2. ‚úÖ Animations are perfectly synchronized
3. ‚úÖ Collapse animation is as smooth as expand
4. ‚úÖ All cards coordinate through context
5. ‚úÖ Visual polish matches premium service standards
6. ‚úÖ Performance is smooth on all devices
7. ‚úÖ Accessibility is fully maintained
