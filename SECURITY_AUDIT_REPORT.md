- Length limits on all fields
- Type checking and coercion

**Protection Against**:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Command Injection
- Buffer overflow attacks

### 5. CSRF Protection ✅

**Location**: `/src/lib/security/csrf.ts`, `/src/middleware/security.ts`

**Features**:
- Cryptographically secure token generation
- HTTP-only cookie storage
- Per-session token validation
- Timing-safe comparison
- Automatic token rotation
- Integration with all state-changing operations

**Protection Against**:
- Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Session hijacking
- Unauthorised actions

### 6. Security Monitoring & Alerting ✅

**Location**: `/src/components/admin/SecurityMonitor.tsx`, `/src/middleware/security.ts`

**Features**:
- Real-time event logging
- Threat categorisation:
  - Rate limit violations
  - CSRF failures
  - Authentication failures
  - Suspicious input patterns
  - SQL injection attempts
- Severity-based alerting (low/medium/high/critical)
