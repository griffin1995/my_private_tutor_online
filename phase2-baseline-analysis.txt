PHASE 2 BASELINE MEASUREMENT - POST-PHASE 1 CLEAN STATE
=========================================================

BUILD TIME METRICS:
- Wall Clock Time: 61.57 seconds (1:01.57)
- CPU Time: 101.68s (user) + 5.09s (system) = 106.77s
- CPU Utilization: 173% (multi-core utilization confirmed)
- Memory Usage: 845.55 MB peak (865848 KB)

BUILD BREAKDOWN:
- Compilation: 37.4s (60.7% of total time)
- Page Generation: ~20s (32.5% of total time)
- Static Pages: 16/43 routes
- Dynamic Pages: 27/43 routes

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
- Phase 1 Completion Baseline: 39.9s (clean measurement)
- Current Measurement: 61.57s
- DISCREPANCY: +21.67s (54.4% slower)

ANALYSIS:
The 61.57s measurement is significantly higher than the Phase 1 baseline of 39.9s.
This is likely due to:
1. Cold cache state (first build after .next removal)
2. Token generation overhead (prebuild script)
3. No filesystem cache available

OPTIMIZATION TARGETS FOR PHASE 2:
1. Turbopack FileSystem Caching: Expected 2-4s improvement on subsequent builds
2. Experimental Features: Expected 1-2s improvement
3. Build Parallelization: Expected 1-2s improvement
4. GOAL: Achieve 25-30s build time (4-14s reduction from 39.9s baseline)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement Turbopack filesystem caching
2. Test cache hit behavior on subsequent builds
3. Measure actual vs expected improvements
4. Validate cache invalidation works correctly
