# Video Masterclass

## "Featured Masterclasses" Can you clarify the setup for the featured masterclasses? I can't tell exactly the setup what you mean? Is it 2 columns x 3 rows.

## Do you have short preview videos so users can easily review on the same screen for paid content?

## Preferred styling: I have included several options for styling for this section as I am unsure what you would prefer (all have relatively equal pros/cons imo, personal preference) (i currently have it setup as my personal preference (very marginal), but at the bottom of the page have included some extra sections with different displays for you to view / decide on what you like best)

# Subject Tuition

## "ANYTHING IN PURPLE Iâ€™D LIKE INCLUDED PLEASE. GREEN CAN BE IGNORED. THANKS" Just for final clarity, do you mean ignored as in "already implemented, don't need to look over it, ignore" or "i don't want this copy anymore, ignore". can't tell if new copy is purple only, or if purple only is new additions? ask because some green is currently implemented and some green is currently not. assume you want purple only.
