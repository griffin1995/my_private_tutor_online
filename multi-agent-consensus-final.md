## üõ°Ô∏è CONSENSUS RISK MITIGATION PLAN

### Risk Matrix with Ownership

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Owner | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Component Breaking Changes | Medium | High | Architecture | Feature flags, incremental refactoring | Version control rollback |
| Performance Regression | Low | High | Performance | A/B testing, progressive enhancement | Service worker fallbacks |
| Deployment Failures | Low | Medium | DevOps | Staged rollouts, canary deployments | Instant rollback capability |
| Type Errors in Production | Medium | Medium | TypeScript | Gradual migration, @ts-expect-error | Parallel type checking |
| User Experience Degradation | Low | High | All | Continuous monitoring, user feedback | Feature toggles |

### Escalation Protocol
1. **Level 1**: Individual agent handles within domain
2. **Level 2**: Cross-agent collaboration required
3. **Level 3**: Full team response with rollback consideration
4. **Level 4**: Executive decision on strategy adjustment
