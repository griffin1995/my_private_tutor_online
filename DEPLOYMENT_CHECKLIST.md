## Deployment Execution

### Step 1: Final Local Verification
```bash
# Run final build
npm run build

# Verify output
ls -la .next/

# Check for errors
grep -i "error" build-validation.log || echo "No errors found"
```

**Expected Result:** Build completes successfully, 91 routes generated

### Step 2: Commit Changes (if needed)
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Stage any final changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "VALIDATION COMPLETE: Design system deployment ready - all quality gates passed"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:** Changes pushed to GitHub successfully

### Step 3: Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production (if using Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod

# OR: Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
```

**Expected Result:** Vercel builds and deploys automatically

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)
# Then verify production URL
```

**Production URL:** https://myprivatetutoronline-f8tv06oa2-jacks-projects-cf5effed.vercel.app

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Immediate Checks (First 30 Minutes)

1. **Verify Homepage Loads**
   - [ ] Navigate to production URL
   - [ ] Check for console errors
   - [ ] Verify brand colors display correctly
   - [ ] Confirm typography renders properly

2. **Test Token Page**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/en/design-tokens-test`
   - [ ] Verify all 25 color tokens visible
   - [ ] Check typography samples
   - [ ] Confirm CSS variables resolve

3. **Cross-Browser Quick Test**
   - [ ] Chrome: Load homepage and token page
   - [ ] Firefox: Load homepage and token page
   - [ ] Safari: Load homepage and token page
   - [ ] Edge: Load homepage and token page

### Critical Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

1. **Vercel Dashboard**
   - [ ] Check deployment status (should be "Ready")
   - [ ] Monitor function errors (should be 0)
   - [ ] Review build logs (no warnings)

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - [ ] Core Web Vitals in "Good" range
   - [ ] LCP <2.5 seconds
   - [ ] CLS <0.1
   - [ ] FID <100ms

3. **Error Tracking (Sentry)**
   - [ ] Check for new errors
   - [ ] Review error rate (target: <0.1%)
   - [ ] Investigate any anomalies

---

## Rollback Procedures (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback Triggers

**Initiate rollback if:**
- Critical accessibility violations detected
- Brand colors rendering incorrectly
- Build failures on production
- User-facing errors >0.5% rate
- Performance degradation >30%

### Rollback Method 1: Git Revert (Recommended)

```bash
# Identify problematic commit
git log --oneline -10

# Revert to previous stable state
git revert <commit-hash>

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy reverted state
```

**Time to Execute:** ~15 minutes (including build)

### Rollback Method 2: Component-Level Override

Create emergency override file:

```bash
# Create override stylesheet
cat > src/styles/emergency-override.css << 'EOF'
/* Emergency Token Override */
:root {
  --color-primary-base: #3F4A7E !important;
  --color-secondary-base: #CA9E5B !important;
  /* Add other critical overrides */
}
EOF

# Import in globals.css
echo '@import "./emergency-override.css";' >> src/styles/globals.css

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
git add . && git commit -m "HOTFIX: Emergency token override" && git push
```

**Time to Execute:** ~20 minutes

### Rollback Method 3: Vercel Instant Rollback

```bash
# Via Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Navigate to Deployments
# 2. Find last stable deployment
# 3. Click "..." menu
# 4. Select "Promote to Production"
```

**Time to Execute:** ~5 minutes (instant rollback)
