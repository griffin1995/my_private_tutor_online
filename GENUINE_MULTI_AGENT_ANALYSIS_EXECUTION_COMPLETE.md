## üìä VERIFIED RESULTS

### Complexity Detection Testing
```javascript
// Test Cases Validated:
"Add tooltips to buttons" ‚Üí simple (2 agents, 15min)
"Implement authentication with JWT" ‚Üí complex (6 agents, 90min)
"Design microservices architecture" ‚Üí complex (6 agents, 90min)
```

### Command Structure Validation
```yaml
# Verified YAML frontmatter present in both files:
description: ‚úÖ Present and compliant
category: ‚úÖ 'analysis' for main, 'deprecated' for old
version: ‚úÖ '2.0' indicating major upgrade
model: ‚úÖ 'auto-select' based on complexity
allowed-tools: ‚úÖ Full Claude Code tool suite
```

### Integration Verification
- ‚úÖ **task-tool-integration.ts**: Enhanced with 2 new public methods
