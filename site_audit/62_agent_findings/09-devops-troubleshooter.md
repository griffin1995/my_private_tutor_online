### ⚠️ DEVOPS GAPS - AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES

#### 5. **Infrastructure as Code Missing (MEDIUM - £8k Risk)**
**Impact**: Manual configuration drift and deployment inconsistency
**Gap Analysis**:
- **No Terraform/CDK**: Infrastructure provisioning is manual
- **No Config Management**: Environment setup requires manual intervention
- **No Version Control**: Infrastructure changes not tracked
- **Deployment Variance**: Different environments may have configuration drift

**Recommendation**: Implement Terraform or AWS CDK for infrastructure automation

#### 6. **Limited Backup Automation (MEDIUM - £5k Risk)**
**Location**: `/src/lib/infrastructure/database-backup.ts`
**Gap Analysis**:
- **Simulated Backups**: Current backup checks are placeholder implementations
- **No Automated Testing**: Backup restoration not validated automatically
- **Manual Recovery**: Disaster recovery requires manual intervention
- **No Geographic Distribution**: Single-region backup strategy

**Recommendation**: Implement automated backup validation and multi-region distribution

#### 7. **Missing Deployment Rollback Automation (LOW - £3k Risk)**
**Gap Analysis**:
- **Manual Rollbacks**: No automated rollback triggers on health check failures
- **No Blue-Green Deployment**: Single deployment environment increases risk
- **No Canary Releases**: All traffic switched at once during deployment
- **Limited A/B Testing**: No automated traffic splitting for deployment validation

**Recommendation**: Implement automated rollback triggers and blue-green deployment

## INTEGRATION WITH SECURITY FINDINGS

### 🔒 **DevOps Security Automation (Building on Agent #8 Findings)**

#### Security Vulnerability Automation Requirements:
1. **CORS Wildcard Fix**: Automate origin whitelist deployment (£45k risk)
2. **JWT Secret Rotation**: Automated key generation and rotation (£52k risk)  
3. **Password Hashing**: Automated bcrypt deployment (£30k risk)
4. **CSP Enforcement**: Automated nonce validation in build pipeline

#### Automated Security Implementation Plan:
```yaml
security-deployment:
  steps:
    - name: "Deploy CORS whitelist"
      run: "sed -i 's/\\*/${ALLOWED_ORIGINS}/g' route.ts"
    - name: "Rotate JWT secrets"
      run: "kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=key=${NEW_JWT_SECRET}"
    - name: "Validate password hashing"
      run: "npm run test:security-authentication"
```
