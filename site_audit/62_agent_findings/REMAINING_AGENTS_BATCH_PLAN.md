## CONSENSUS TRACKING

### Infrastructure Consensus Points
1. Single-region deployment is critical risk (5/5 agents agree)
2. No IaC implementation exists (5/5 agents agree)
3. Serverless architecture appropriate (4/5 agents agree)
4. Vendor lock-in risk exists (5/5 agents agree)
5. Monitoring gaps significant (5/5 agents agree)

### Expected Additional Consensus
- Bundle size excessive (Frontend agents)
- Test coverage insufficient (QA agents)
- TypeScript typing incomplete (Programming agents)
- CI/CD needs enhancement (Operations agents)

## QUALITY GATES
