# ARCHITECTURE-REVIEWER COORDINATION SUMMARY

## Phase 2 Domain Restructuring Supporting Performance Optimization

### EXECUTIVE BRIEFING FOR PERFORMANCE-ENGINEER

**Architecture-Reviewer Status**: Domain restructuring foundation complete
**Current Analysis**: 353 components → 50 target (86% reduction potential)
**Coordination Points**: Bundle optimization, service caching, module boundaries
**Immediate Impact**: Enabling optimal code splitting and tree-shaking

---

## ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE ✅

### Current State Assessment (CRITICAL FINDINGS)

#### 1. COMPONENT CHAOS: 353 Total Components

```
DOMAIN OVERFLOW DETECTED:
- FAQ: 87 components (25% of total) - SEVERE domain bleeding
- UI: 49 components (mixed responsibilities)
- Admin: 8 components (reasonable scope)
- Analytics: 7 components (cross-cutting concerns)
- Performance: 4 duplicate monitoring components
```

**Impact on Your Optimization**:

- Bundle splitting inefficient due to unclear boundaries
- Tree-shaking limited by cross-domain dependencies
- Code duplication increasing bundle size

#### 2. SERVICE FRAGMENTATION: 40+ Services

```
SERVICE REDUNDANCY:
- CMS: 15+ services with overlapping responsibilities
- Analytics: 10+ tracking services with duplicate logic
- Monitoring: 5+ performance services (redundant metrics)
```

**Impact on Your Caching Strategy**:

- Multiple cache points reducing efficiency
- Inconsistent TTL strategies across services
- No unified cache warming approach

## DOMAIN RESTRUCTURING READY FOR COORDINATION

### New Architecture Structure Created ✅

```
src/
├── domains/           [CREATED] - Clear bundle boundaries
│   ├── tutoring/     - Core business domain
│   ├── booking/      - Booking system isolation
│   ├── analytics/    - Analytics consolidation
│   └── admin/        - Admin separation
├── shared/           [CREATED] - Shared resources
│   └── ui/          - Pure UI components
└── infrastructure/   [CREATED] - Technical layer
    ├── monitoring/  - Unified monitoring
    └── cache/       - Centralized caching
```

### Coordination Points for Bundle Optimization

#### 1. CODE SPLITTING ALIGNMENT

```typescript
// My domain boundaries enable your chunks
export const domainChunks = {
	tutoring: ['homepage', 'about', 'services'], // Preload
	booking: ['calendar', 'form', 'payment'], // Lazy
	analytics: ['tracking', 'reports'], // Background
	admin: ['dashboard', 'management'], // On-demand
};
```

#### 2. SERVICE CONSOLIDATION FOR CACHING

```typescript
// Unified services supporting your cache strategy
export const consolidatedServices = {
	cms: {
		before: 15, // Fragmented services
		after: 1, // UnifiedCMSService
		cacheStrategy: 'stale-while-revalidate',
		ttl: 3600,
	},
	analytics: {
		before: 10,
		after: 1,
		cacheStrategy: 'background-sync',
		ttl: 86400,
	},
};
```

#### 3. TREE-SHAKING ENABLEMENT

```typescript
// Clear boundaries enable optimal tree-shaking
export const treeShakingImpact = {
	currentDeadCode: '~80KB', // Estimated from duplicates
	afterMigration: '<5KB', // With clear boundaries
	bundleSizeReduction: '75KB potential',
};
```

## BLOCKING ISSUES REQUIRING YOUR INPUT

### 1. Bundle Priority Decision

**Question**: Which domains should be in the critical path?

```
Option A: tutoring + shared (smallest initial bundle)
Option B: tutoring + booking (business priority)
Option C: Progressive enhancement (your recommendation?)
```

### 2. Cache Strategy Confirmation

**Question**: Confirm cache strategies for domains?

```typescript
Proposed:
- tutoring: 'stale-while-revalidate' (1hr)
- booking: 'network-first' (5min)
- analytics: 'background-sync' (24hr)
- admin: 'cache-first' (30min)
```

### 3. Migration Sequence

**Question**: Component migration priority?

```
Option 1: FAQ components first (biggest impact)
Option 2: Core business components first (stability)
Option 3: Your optimization priority?
```

---

## SUCCESS METRICS ALIGNMENT

### Shared KPIs

```typescript
export const sharedMetrics = {
	bundleSize: {
		current: '229KB',
		target: '150KB',
		myContribution: '40KB reduction', // Clean architecture
		yourContribution: '39KB reduction', // Optimization
	},

	performance: {
		current: { fcp: 2.1, lcp: 3.2 },
		target: { fcp: 1.0, lcp: 1.5 },
		architectureImpact: '30% improvement',
		optimizationImpact: '40% improvement',
