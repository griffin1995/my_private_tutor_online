![hero section](image.png) make video smaller, include white space on all sides, add scrolling school etc under it (still in initial 100% viewport height)

## my feedback on updates/revisions

## my questions

# about page

![simple hero section](image-6.png) still not really a fan of this at all. i knwo you wanted same width, doesnt look great on certain pages.

![pre intro](image-7.png) did you still want this highlighter? was unsure with the sep 19th copy changes

![alt text](image-8.png) believe all copy updated accurately, will triple check when others are fine. small white space added to left / right of screen. do you want images touching the far sides? prior they were, but i changed slightly as most other content across site is no longer 100% width so thought bit more consistency re that might be prefered? let me know

![alt text](image-9.png)

![results section](image-10.png) confused re exactly how you want the copy / positioning of sections. do you still want the blue ones instead of the ones with images? or just new images

# subject tuition

![compressed accordion](image-12.png) used accordion, nice for large amount of content without being too messy. photos also load on the fly so not long loading time / processing time for mobile / 4/5g

# how it works

![pre intro quote](image-13.png) do you want the h1 above or below this? copy revisions did not include this part
