# Navbar / Footer

![footer current](image-14.png)

The navigation bar could be shortened. I also suggest removing _Testimonials_ as a main heading, as most sites do not feature it this way. It would work better in the footer, e.g.:

| Services     | Resources                 | About Us / Company / (better name) | Legal (better name) |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| All services | Links to free videos      | Request a free consultation        | Contact             |
|              | Free downloadable content | About us                           | Privacy policy      |
|              |                           | Meet the team                      | Terms of service    |
|              |                           | Testimonials                       | Cookies policy      |

![navbr drop down](image-17.png)  
• Need to change sub-links to be more accurate/exhaustive  
• Need to find a PNG/SVG for an arrow that you like; in my opinion, the current one looks cheap  
• Need to make the arrow a fixed position on screen so it doesn’t change relative to the number of sub-links (looks ugly when going from one drop-down to another and the arrow changes position whilst nothing else does)

# Landing Page

![hero section](image.png)  
• Make the video smaller  
• Add white space on all sides  
• Include a scrolling school element beneath (still within the initial 100% viewport height) (still needs slight tweak)

![intro without videos](image-2.png)  
Struggled to get the video anywhere in the initial section looking good

![intro video](image-3.png)  
Will fix if you are happy with the video below (something like the new hero section if you like that)

![who we support](image-15.png)  
• Section is slightly too large  
• Revise so the entire section fits within the screen height

![quote section](image-5.png)  
• I need to check the most recent version of copy

# About Page

![simple hero section](image-6.png)  
• Current layout still not effective  
• Consistent width intention understood, but the design does not look good on certain pages

![pre intro](image-16.png)  
• Do you still want this highlighter effect?  
• Unclear after the 19th September copy changes

![alt text](image-9.png)  
• Copy appears accurate, but will triple-check when others are final  
• Added white space to left and right margins  
• Question: Should images touch the page edges?  
 • Previously they did  
 • Most content across the site is no longer full width, so added space for consistency

![results section](image-10.png)  
• Unclear how copy and layout should be arranged  
• Do you still want the blue sections instead of the image-based ones?  
• Or just updated images?

# Subject Tuition

![compressed accordion](image-12.png)  
• Accordion layout used for large amounts of content  
• Keeps page tidy and uncluttered  
• Images load dynamically, which prevents slow loading times on mobile (4G/5G)  
I could additionally make it as 'tabs', similar to what I implemented on the Homeschooling page (after a clean-up).

# How It Works

![pre intro quote](image-13.png)  
• Should the H1 heading appear above or below this section?  
• Copy revisions did not include this part

![alt text](image-27.png)  
New section done; can send screenshots if needed, but have to make some CMS changes for it to build properly.

---

# Homeschooling

![alt text](image-28.png)  
Revising to the three-tall pillar style for consistency.  
All other junk will be removed.  
Let me know if you are happy with the 'tab' style and I will improve the styling.

# Tutors

Need a new hero image.  
Want to make the 'pop-up' info for each tutor span the full width; low priority as it is functional now.

---

# 11+ bootcamps

Images updated.  
Slight padding/positioning fixes needed for schools.

---

# FAQ

Think this copy is fine/finished.  
Will update styles slightly when other fixes are done.
