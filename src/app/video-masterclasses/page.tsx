            paragraphOne="The British university admissions system represents one of the most intricate and high-stakes processes that families will ever navigate. UCAS applications are governed by unwritten rules, implicit expectations, and nuanced requirements that can confound even highly educated parents. The personal statement alone - a 4,000 character document that can determine a young person's entire future - operates according to criteria that are rarely made explicit. The stakes are particularly high for competitive courses and prestigious institutions, where the margin for error is virtually nonexistent. Understanding university selection strategies, reference requirements, and timeline management requires intimate knowledge of how admissions departments actually evaluate candidates. Elizabeth Burrows has helped countless students secure offers from Oxbridge and top Russell Group universities. Unlock her expertise in these two masterclasses, as delivered at London School of Economics."

            paragraphOne="Cultural literacy is the unspoken foundation of success in British education. Literary knowledge, shared references and historical context quietly shape classroom discussion, exam questions and peer dynamics. International families often find capable children disadvantaged by these invisible cues, affecting interviews, seminar participation and confidence. Equally decisive is social navigation: the centuries-old codes that govern schools and universities - from dining etiquette in boarding houses to admissions protocols and teacher expectations. Social fluency influences opportunities, relationships and perceived fit as much as grades. In these two masterclasses Elizabeth Burrows guide explores the cultural capital and institutional conventions students must decode, helping families bridge gaps academic ability alone cannot close."
