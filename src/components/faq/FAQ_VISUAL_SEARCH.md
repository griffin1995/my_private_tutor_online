# FAQ Visual Search Feature

## Overview
The FAQ Visual Search feature allows users to upload screenshots of errors or issues and automatically matches them against the FAQ database using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Tesseract.js**: Client-side OCR processing for text extraction from images
- **React Dropzone**: Drag-and-drop file upload interface with image preview
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations and visual feedback
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript as basic file upload

### Privacy-First Approach
- **Client-side processing**: All OCR processing happens in the browser
- **No server uploads**: Images never leave the user's device
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of blob URLs and worker resources

### Features

#### Image Upload
- Drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback
- Support for PNG, JPG, WebP, HEIC formats
- File size validation (5MB limit)
- Image preview with editing capabilities
- Progress tracking during upload and processing

#### OCR Processing
- Text extraction using Tesseract.js WebWorker
- Error message pattern recognition
- Technical terminology extraction
- Multi-language support (currently English)
- Processing time optimization (<3s target)

#### Smart Matching
- Text similarity matching against FAQ content
- Error code recognition and mapping
- Keyword-based scoring system
- Confidence threshold filtering (30% minimum)
- Contextual suggestion generation

#### User Experience
- Real-time progress indicators
- Visual feedback during processing
- Animated state transitions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Integration Points

#### Enhanced Search Component
The visual search integrates seamlessly with the existing FAQ enhanced search:
- Toggle between text and visual search modes
- Auto-populate search with extracted OCR text
- Merge results with traditional search
- Consistent UI/UX patterns

#### FAQ System Integration
- Works with existing FAQ categories and questions
- Maintains search performance standards
- Supports existing filtering and analytics
- Compatible with multi-language content

### Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Strategies
- OCR worker reuse to minimize initialization overhead
- WebWorker implementation for non-blocking processing
- Progressive image loading
- Memory cleanup for uploaded images
- Confidence scoring to limit result sets

#### Performance Targets
- OCR processing: <3 seconds for typical screenshots
- Image upload: Real-time preview generation
- Search matching: <100ms for result computation
- Memory usage: Proper cleanup of resources

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebAssembly support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- File API support required for full functionality
- WebWorker support for optimal performance

### Error Handling
- OCR processing failures with user-friendly messages
- File format validation and error reporting
- Network connectivity handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

### Analytics Integration
- OCR success/failure rates
- Processing time metrics
- User interaction patterns
- Search result effectiveness
- Error pattern recognition accuracy

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
<FAQVisualSearch
  questions={questions}
  categories={categories}
  onSearchResults={handleResults}
  onOCRText={handleOCRText}
  placeholder="Upload a screenshot of your issue..."
/>
```

### Advanced Configuration
```typescript
<FAQVisualSearch
  questions={questions}
  categories={categories}
  onSearchResults={handleResults}
  onOCRText={handleOCRText}
  maxFileSize={5 * 1024 * 1024}
  supportedFormats={['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/webp']}
  confidenceThreshold={0.3}
  className="custom-styling"
/>
```
