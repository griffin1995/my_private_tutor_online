I loved a challenge, and applying to Cambridge to read English and Theatre with Education Studies was certainly that.",
        "But my offer letter was as much cause for agitation as celebration. You see, I had already fallen in love with another course and city: Bristol. My elder sister was studying languages there and although I had doggedly courted a Cambridge offer, I hadn't considered a world in which I would actually receive one. What to do? Who turns down *Cambridge*? 17 year-old me. It was an agonizing decision, but even then I knew the right one. Looking back, I realise that dilemma helped define my ethos towards education: **work as hard as you can to give yourself the luxury of choice, then have the confidence to pick what's right for you — even if it's not what's expected.**"
