			"heading": "Meet Elizabeth, A Different Kind of Educator",
			"content": "Considering how unconventional my own schooling was, I often find myself chuckling that I'm in my second decade of a career in education. My path through school wasn't linear; I think that's one of the reasons families trust me. I'm motivated by helping children when it feels like there are no straight lines, only a confusing jumble of squiggles. That's when my team and I can make a real impact. I moved through six different schools growing up, across private, state, faith, co-educational and single-sex systems (including a boys' school run by monks — yes, really). My learning could have easily suffered, especially since I have Dyspraxia, but one constant made a huge difference: my tutor. She not only gave me academic consistency but something far more valuable — a quiet confidence and the belief that excellence was achievable, even in turbulent times."

			"title": "Going Against the Grain",
			"content": "By Sixth Form, I was achieving top grades. I hadn't planned to apply to Oxbridge, but when my headmistress pulled me aside to ask if I'd considered it, something inside me switched on. I loved a challenge, and applying to Cambridge to read English and Theatre with Education Studies was certainly that. But my offer letter was as much cause for agitation as celebration. You see, I had already fallen in love with another course and city: Bristol. My elder sister was studying languages there and although I had doggedly courted a Cambridge offer, I hadn't considered a world in which I would actually receive one. What to do? Who turns down Cambridge? 17 year-old me. It was an agonizing decision, but even then I knew the right one. Looking back, I realise that dilemma helped define my ethos towards education: work as hard as you can to give yourself the luxury of choice, then have the confidence to pick what's right for you — even if it's not what's expected."

These leaders had turned their fortunes around through education. What could be more exciting and important?"
