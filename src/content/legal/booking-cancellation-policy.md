Following the first prepaid session, tuition is billed monthly in arrears, with payment due immediately upon receipt of the invoice.

Invoices not paid within 3 business days of issue will incur daily interest at 1.5% per day.

MPTO reserves the right to suspend tuition until full payment (including interest) is received.

The Client is responsible for all bank transfer charges or international payment fees.

2.6 Duplicate Clause (Consolidated)

Interest and suspension terms are as referenced in Clause 2.4.
