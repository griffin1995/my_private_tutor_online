**Three secrets for surviving exam season - how parents can help their
child succeed.**

***\'In this life nothing can be said to be certain, except taxes and
death[']{dir="rtl"} - Benjamin Franklin*** 

Franklin was a genius but he left one, very important, item off the
list: exams. Because whether you are a brain surgeon or a tree surgeon
you have to battle your way through a fair share of formal assessments
to get there. And thank goodness. After all, who wants to be the patient
of a dentist who hasn[']{dir="rtl"}t been properly put through their
paces? But whilst exams are essential they\'re often not particularly
enjoyable --- for parents as much as pupils.

Many of us sat our exams more moons ago than we care to remember. And
what little knowledge we have managed to cling onto may no longer be
relevant to children today. **They[']{dir="rtl"}ve changed the way
students learn statistics and study Shakespeare. That[']{dir="rtl"}s
okay; that[']{dir="rtl"}s what tutors are for!** But what parents can do
is brush up on how they can support the revision process. Effective
facilitation is as, if not more, important than being able to recite the
periodic table to your twelve year old by heart. Here are **three rules
to give your child the best chance of success their exams and, equally
importantly, the two of you emerging as friends at the other end.**

**Tip #1 - Preparation Is Everything**

Revision is like baking an elaborate cake; there are many ingredients,
methods and layers that need to combine to form the finished product.
You wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t try and bake a three-tiered cake without a
detailed recipe, nor should your child embark on revision without a
solid timetable.

Each student[']{dir="rtl"}s timetable is unique and will vary according
to how much time they have before their exams, how confident they feel
with each subject and how long they can study before losing focus. **As
a rule, revision should start as early as possible.** It is much better
to do a little often for six weeks than cram 48 hours before the test.
Indeed, a **study by the University of Durham and Sutton Trust found
that students who spaced their revision across a number of days and
weeks had a better absorption and retention rate** than those who
didn[']{dir="rtl"}t.

Many students find it beneficial to study two or three different
subjects a day to avoid burning out on one topic. **An average study day
shouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t exceed eight hours of revision** (less for
younger students). It[']{dir="rtl"}s also important that sessions are
broken down into manageable chunks of ideally **no more than an hour at
a time**. The break between sessions is when you, the parent, come into
your own; offer them words of encouragement, healthy snacks and a
welcome change of scene. Note: this is probably not the time to scold
them for leaving their socks on the floor --- keep it positive!

Aside from the academics, **try and schedule [']{dir="rtl"}fun
sessions[']{dir="rtl"} into the weekly timetable.** This could be a trip
to the cinema with friends, a meal out with the family or a picnic in
the park. You may need to negotiate on how many social sessions are
allowed, but it[']{dir="rtl"}s important for children to remember that
**they are a person first before they are a pupil, even during exam
season.**

**Tip #2 - An Environment for Education**

Take a moment to consider your work setting. What environment do you
perform best in? Can you concentrate in a busy office with a cluttered
desk and noisy conversations going on around you, or do you need the
calm of a quiet, ordered space to succeed? It[']{dir="rtl"}s exactly the
same for students. A child can have the most foolproof revision plan in
the world, but it will fail if not executed in the right environment.

Let[']{dir="rtl"}s start with the basics. **Students need a dedicated,
organised study space in order to flourish.** That means a proper desk
and chair in a ventilated room with natural light, ideally somewhere
quiet. They should have a **constant supply of water** (avoid fizzy and
caffeinated drinks) and healthy snacks (fresh fruit, nuts and seeds
etc.). The temperature of the room is also important; some students
become drowsy in an overly warm space. **Siblings and pets should be
kept away**and general distractions kept to a minimum. This includes
phones, as much as your teenager may disagree with you...

One study showed that students who text or use social media more
frequently get lower grades and another investigation by the University
of Southern Maine revealed that the mere sight of a mobile can be
distracting. This is a battle you may or may not want to pick with your
child, but science suggests that phones need to be put away!

The question of listening to music whilst studying is an interesting
one. Some studies find that it diminishes students ability to retain and
recall information, whereas others endorse it as an effective revision
strategy. It is ultimately a personal preference, but it should be noted
that anything with lyrics is likely to be more distracting than
instrumental music alone.

and another investigation revealed that **the mere sight of a mobile can
be distracting.**\" -- University of Southern Maine

There are certain essentials parents can implement to support their
children outside the revision room too. Principally, **exercise and
sleep**. The influence of exercise on the brain is widely celebrated;
something as small as taking the dog for a walk during a study break can
improve mental cognition and also general mood. Equally, without enough
good quality sleep revision becomes much harder than it needs to be.
Adolescents under 18 years old should get **at least eight hours sleep a
night and phones and computers should ideally be put away in the last
hour before bed**.

**Tip #3 - The Big Day**

So it[']{dir="rtl"}s the night before the exam. Your child has, ideally,
followed their revision schedule and been studying in a set revision
space for weeks. What now? This is often when parents can feel most
powerless; students either know the information now or they
don[']{dir="rtl"}t. But there are a few things parents can do to make
pupils feel better prepared in the final hours.

First, and perhaps most importantly, sleep. A little last minute
revision is fine, but **encourage your child to get to bed at a
reasonable time **--- at least eight hours before they need to be up in
the morning. The next day your support can continue. **From the moment
they wake up try and keep all communication as positive as possible**;
the last thing either of you need right now is an argument. Ensure they
**eat a good breakfast**. Scientific studies have found that skipping
breakfast negatively affects concentration and memory levels. Something
wholesome that releases energy slowly over the course of the morning is
ideal: go for porridge and bananas over sugary cereals.

Before leaving the house take a minute to **check your
child[']{dir="rtl"}s backpack**. What kind of exam is it? **Have they
got everything they need?** For maths they may require a scientific
calculator and set of compasses. For English they[']{dir="rtl"}ll need
highlighters. It[']{dir="rtl"}s a little thing, but a quick check can
safeguard your child from the unnecessary stress of realising
they[']{dir="rtl"}ve forgotten something moments before entering the
exam room.

Finally, earlier in the morning take a minute to check the traffic
headlines. The last thing either of you need is to miss the exam because
the roads are unexpectedly gridlocked. **Give yourself double the usual
travel time to get to school,** just to be on the safe side. Finally,
**a few choice words of encouragement as your child leaves the car** can
do wonders. Exams are a trying time for pupils and parents, but a little
reminder that you have faith in them is often enough to set them on the
path to success!

**Finally, good luck - you (both) got this!**
