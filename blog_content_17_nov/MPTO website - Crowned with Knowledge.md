**An Education Fit For a King**

Exactly how *do* you educate a future monarch? From the first day at
nursery to the last day of a degree, we chronicle how three generations
of British blue-bloods go from [']{dir="rtl"}ABC[']{dir="rtl"} to PhD.
The royal family[']{dir="rtl"}s school report reveals a chequered past
of high flyers and high school drop-outs...

**THE ANCIENT PATHS OF KINGS **

Historian David Starkey caused a stir in 2007 when he declared that the
late **Queen Elizabeth II** was poorly educated and a philistine.
[']{dir="rtl"}I suppose it[']{dir="rtl"}s this absence of any kind of,
to be blunt, serious education[']{dir="rtl"} he announced. It was a bold
claim and one that met with widespread outrage. 

Although she didn[']{dir="rtl"}t go to University and never sat a formal
exam in her life, the Queen was widely regarded as being naturally
bright and intelligent. But comparing Elizabeth II with her predecessor
**Elizabeth I** (who also ascended the throne at 25 years old) Starkey
may have a point. **King Henry VIII**[']{dir="rtl"}s daughter was
strictly schooled and fluent in five or six languages. 17th century
princesses were not raised to rule so their education could be pretty
patchy, but Elizabeth I benefited from the Age of Enlightenment and the
emphasis it placed on education. As Historian Aysha Pollnitz notes,
during the 1600s [']{dir="rtl"}British princes male and female spent
more time learning to wield pens than swords or guns[']{dir="rtl"} and
were [']{dir="rtl"}notably bookish[']{dir="rtl"} in comparison with
their Spanish counterparts.

**Elizabeth I and HRH Elizabeth II** may have varied in their degree of
academic rigour, but the two Queens were united in *how* they were
educated. For over a thousand years monarchs were traditionally taught
by private tutors. Elizabeth I had Cambridge academic Roger Ascham and
Elizabeth II had Sir Henry Marten, the Vice-Provost of Eton College.
Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were the last members of the royal
family to be educated in this way. The Queen[']{dir="rtl"}s children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren have attended some of
Britain[']{dir="rtl"}s best public schools...

**LEARNING YOUR ABCs **

Who could resist the picture of little **Princess Charlotte** ready for
her first day at Willcocks Nursery School? Posing for pictures as she
left Kensington Palace, the toddler was brimming with excitement for her
first steps into education. Willcocks Nursery (also attended by **Prince
Louis**) only employs female staff, is less than half a mile away from
Kensington Palace and described by *Tatler* magazine as a
[']{dir="rtl"}hidden gem[']{dir="rtl"} that [']{dir="rtl"}flies under
the radar.[']{dir="rtl"} Students come from a range of British and
[']{dir="rtl"}chic European[']{dir="rtl"} families, some of whom
register their child for a place at birth.

The **Duke and Duchess of Cambridge** took a different approach with
their eldest child, **Prince George**. Living in Norfolk at the time,
the young heir apparent attended Westacre Montessori Nursery School
where tuition then cost just £33/day and 85% of children received
funding. The Montessori method places emphasis on independence, freedom
and social development. Children are taught in mixed age groups, given a
choice of activities and free to move around the classroom. **Princess
Diana** actually taught at a Montessori nursery before she married, so
perhaps there was personal significance behind **William and
Kate**[']{dir="rtl"}s choice.

**Prince George** enjoyed a fairly fluid start to his education at
Westacre, but things stepped up a notch when he started
[']{dir="rtl"}big school[']{dir="rtl"} in 2018. Thomas[']{dir="rtl"}s
Battersea in London schools 540 pupils between the ages of four and 13.
Fees are £32,886 a year, which includes freshly prepared organic meals.
Prince George was in a co-educational class of up to 22 children and ---
as a July baby --- was one of the youngest in the school.

**Princes William and Harry** were also educated in the public sector.
Both brothers attended Mrs.  Mynor[']{dir="rtl"}s Nursery School in
Notting Hill Gate before continuing their preparatory schooling at
Ludgrove School in Berkshire. Their father **HRH King Charles** attended
Cheam School, Hampshire, and Hill House, London.

**GETTING THOSE GCSEs**

Whilst junior school is perhaps the place for children to discover and
develop a sense of self, secondary school is arguably where things get
serious. There are exams to be studied for, not least GCSEs and A
levels. The royals have consistently chosen the country[']{dir="rtl"}s
top schools for their children. But elite doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t
necessarily mean enjoyable; some royals openly loathed their time at
school.

 

**King Charles** claims he had a [']{dir="rtl"}disastrous[']{dir="rtl"}
time at school. He attended prestigious Scottish boarding school
Gordonstoun, a place he famously described as [']{dir="rtl"}Colditz in
kilts[']{dir="rtl"}. At sixteen years old he was the first heir to the
throne to sit O Levels (renamed [']{dir="rtl"}GCSEs[']{dir="rtl"}),
passing six. Interestingly, he steered his own sons away from Scotland
and chose to send them to the institution he was, allegedly, originally
destined for instead.

**Eton College** has been synonymous with royalty ever since the young
Maharajas of the Sikh Empire were sent there in the late 19th Century.
Since then the distinguished school has educated Saudi Sheiks, European
Princes and British monarchs-in-waiting. **Princes William and Harry**
both boarded at the £63,297 a year institution. Legend has it that every
Sunday afternoon William would walk the short stretch from Eton to
Windsor Castle where he would have tea with his grandmother while she
schooled him on royal duties. Prince William left with A Levels in
History, Geography and Biology. Little brother Harry left with A Levels
in Art and Geography, concluding his academic education. He
doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t have a University degree but completed ten months
of officer commissioning training at the Royal Military Academy
Sandhurst.

The Windsor ladies have carved their own distinct and varied educational
paths. **Princess Anne** spent her teenage years enjoying horse riding
and the great British outdoors at Benenden School in Kent. Before she
became a princess, **Diana** attended West Heath Girls[']{dir="rtl"}
School in Kent where she failed her O levels (twice) and dropped out
aged 16. Academia might not have been for her, but etiquette certainly
was. The young socialite finished her education at Institut Alpin
Videmanette, an elite Swiss finishing school.

In terms of the younger royals, **Princess Beatrice** attended St.
George[']{dir="rtl"}s Ascot and **Princess Eugenie** studied at
Marlborough College in Wiltshire (as did Kate Middleton). Eugenie scored
two  As and a B at A Level, making her the brightest royal of the bunch.
American import **Meghan Markle** first attended a private Catholic
school in Los Angeles before reading Theatre and International Relations
at Northwestern University, Chicago. The lure of the limelight beckoned
and soon after graduating Meghan embarked on her career in
entertainment.

**BAGGING A PHD**

So it[']{dir="rtl"}s a bit of cheat, but many members of the royal
family actually hold doctorate degrees. In fact, **King Charles** has 11
of them. Varying from a Doctor of Philosophy from Al-Azhar University,
Egypt, to a Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University, HRH has an
impressive haul of academic honours. The degree of note, however, is his
MA in History from Trinity College, Cambridge. The young prince was
awarded the 2:2 degree in 1970. Charles not only studied history, he
also made it: it was the first time an heir apparent had completed
University.

 Flash forward a generation, and nearly all of today[']{dir="rtl"}s
young royals have studied at University. **Prince William** famously met
his future wife, **Kate Middleton**, whilst studying Geography at St.
Andrews University in Fife, Scotland. Little brother Harry opted for
more of an action man experience and spent ten months training at
esteemed military academy Sandhurst.

Cousins **Peter and Zara Phillips** both studied at Exeter University
where they excelled on the field, Peter playing rugby league and Zara
horsing around (Princess Anne[']{dir="rtl"}s daughter won a silver
Olympic medal for showjumping in 2012). 

In terms of the York clan, **Princess Beatrice** --- who has dyslexia
--- studied History and the History of Ideas at Goldsmith University in
London, whilst little sister **Eugenie** headed north to Newcastle
University where she read English Literature and History of Art. Rumour
has it that Eugenie was initially rejected by the University until they
realised she was a royal and quickly offered her a place...

From private tutors to top universities, royal education has long
mirrored the evolution of Britain itself --- steeped in tradition yet
constantly adapting to modern values. Whether through the quiet
discipline of the classroom or the public test of duty, the making of a
monarch is never purely academic. Royal or not, the lesson endures: the
best education shapes not only the mind but the character, preparing
each generation --- future kings and commoners alike --- not just to
succeed, but to serve.
