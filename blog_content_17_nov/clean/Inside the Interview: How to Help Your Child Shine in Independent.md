**Inside the Interview: How to Help Your Child Shine in Independent School
Interviews**

The school interview, whether at 11+, 13+ or 16+, is as much about character as
academics. It is an opportunity for admissions teams to gauge maturity, social
confidence and intellectual spark.

**Schools Look for Thoughtfulness, Not Slick Coaching**

Most interviewers agree that overly rehearsed answers are noticeable
immediately. As one senior tutor at Winchester put it:

["]{dir="rtl"}We want to meet the child---not the script."

Encourage your child to speak naturally, express opinions, and discuss what
genuinely excites them.

**Develop Conversational Intelligence**

Children who can listen, build on ideas and articulate themselves stand out.
Activities that help include:

Discussing current affairs at dinner

Exploring [']{dir="rtl"}why[']{dir="rtl"} questions together

Analysing stories, articles or puzzles

These build the cognitive flexibility schools prize.

**Show Authentic Enthusiasm**

Whether it[']{dir="rtl"}s robotics, violin, mythology or football---authentic
interest is compelling. Schools want children who will join teams, ensembles and
societies, not simply sit exams well.

**A Final Word for Parents**

The best interview preparation strengthens curiosity, confidence and
presence---not rehearsed monologues.

**My Private Tutor Online offers tailored interview coaching with specialists
who help students speak thoughtfully, articulate ideas clearly and present
themselves with genuine confidence.**
