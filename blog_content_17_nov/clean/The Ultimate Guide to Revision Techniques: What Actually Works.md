**The Ultimate Guide to Revision Techniques: What Actually Works According to
Research**

Revision is not about rewriting notes; it is about making the brain work. The
most effective strategies are surprisingly simple---and consistently validated
by research.

**Active Recall Is King**

Decades of cognitive science show that attempting to retrieve information
strengthens memory far more effectively than re-reading.\
Techniques include:

Flashcards

Mini-tests

Explaining concepts aloud

A Meta-Analysis from Purdue University found that retrieval practice improves
exam performance by **up to 50%**.

**Spaced Repetition Outperforms Cramming**

Spacing learning across days or weeks rebuilds neural pathways. Students who
revise using spaced repetition remember vastly more over time.

**Interleaving Boosts Long-Term Mastery**

Mixing topics---rather than studying one block at a time---trains the brain to
sift, compare and distinguish between concepts.

**A Final Word for Parents**

When revision is strategic, students retain more and stress less.
