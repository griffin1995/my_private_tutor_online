**Top 3 Tips for Navigating the 7+, 11+, 13+ and 16+ Entry Points Successfully**

Each admissions stage brings its own pressures, expectations and nuances. Yet
across all the major entry points---from the formative 7+ to the competitive
16+---three principles consistently shape success.

**1. Understand the Specific Assessment Style**

Independent schools do not use a universal format. Some lean on traditional
English/Maths papers; others emphasise problem-solving, verbal reasoning or
creative writing.\
At 16+, many now request academic essays or cognitive aptitude tests.

Parents who understand the precise format early often reduce stress
significantly and enable targeted practice.

**2. Prepare for Interview ["]{dir="rtl"}Thinking Aloud" Tasks**

Interview questions increasingly require children to _explain their reasoning_,
not just provide answers.\
Typical prompts include:

["]{dir="rtl"}What might happen if...?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Why do you think the author chose this?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Convince me that this statement is true/false."

This assesses verbal reasoning, confidence and personality---skills not learned
through worksheets alone.

**3. Start Early---Earlier Than You Think**

Top schools often say they want ["]{dir="rtl"}natural" ability, but the truth is
that well-prepared children perform more confidently.\
For competitive London schools, families typically begin informal preparation
**12--24 months** in advance.

**A Final Word for Parents**

Admissions success is a mixture of readiness, awareness and steady
confidence-building---not pressure.
