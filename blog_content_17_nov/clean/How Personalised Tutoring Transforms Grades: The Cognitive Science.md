**How Personalised Tutoring Transforms Grades: The Cognitive Science Parents
Should Know**

Parents are increasingly turning to tutoring not for cramming, but for
_clarity_---precision teaching tailored to how each child learns. And the data
strongly supports this approach.

**Why Personalisation Works**

The EEF reports that **one-to-one tuition can accelerate progress by up to five
months in a single term**, while small-group instruction offers similarly robust
gains.

This is because personalised teaching targets exactly where misconceptions
occur, something classroom teachers with 25--30 pupils simply cannot always do.

**The Power of Responsive Feedback**

Cognitive scientists such as Prof. John Hattie (Visible Learning) show that
_feedback_---when specific and immediate---has one of the highest effect sizes
on academic progress.

Personal tutoring ensures students receive:

Instant clarification

Live modelling of solutions

Step-by-step scaffolding

Correction of ingrained errors

**The Learning Confidence Boost**

Confidence is not a soft metric. Studies show that self-efficacy strongly
predicts exam outcomes. When students feel competent, they attempt more
challenges, leading to a positive cycle of achievement.

**A Final Word for Parents**

Great tutoring is an accelerator of understanding, not a substitute for
school---an academic force multiplier.
