**Supporting High Achievers with SEN: How to Nurture Potential When Needs Are
Complex**

It is a misconception that SEN only affects struggling learners. Many gifted
children also experience dyslexia, ADHD, ASD or processing challenges that mask
their true academic capacity.

**High Ability and SEN Are Not Mutually Exclusive**

The British Dyslexia Association notes that **up to 10% of dyslexic students
exhibit superior reasoning or creative strengths**.\
Likewise, students with ADHD often outperform peers in divergent thinking tasks.

**The Risk of Underachievement**

Without tailored support, high-achieving SEN students can become frustrated,
disengaged or anxious. Bright pupils ["]{dir="rtl"}fall through the cracks" when
their strong intellect compensates for underlying difficulties---until the
workload intensifies.

**Targeted, Strength-Led Support**

Evidence-based SEN support includes:

Structured literacy interventions

Assistive technology

Chunked instructions

Coaching to develop executive function

Multisensory teaching techniques

When done well, these strategies transform potential into sustained achievement.

**A Final Word for Parents**

Your child[']{dir="rtl"}s strengths are the foundation---not the footnote---of
their learning journey.

high-achieving children with tailored strategies that respect their abilities
