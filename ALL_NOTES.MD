JACK AND BETH - WEBSITE REFRESH (MAIN FILE, CONTENT FURTHER DOWN IS MORE RECENT)

Hi Jack,

I just wanted to share this Doc with you to use as a central point for coordinating the website refresh. I figure with different docs for each of the webpages it would be helpful to have one doc as an anchor point. 

Here’s an updated sitemap. It may still change and I’ll of course let you know if it does. Pages in green I’ve drafted and sent you (copy may still change a bit, but central sections for each page are in place), pages in blue are yet to be created (hopefully within the next 48 hours ideally). 

I expect we may need a shared folder for me to drop the images/videos etc. in for you to access. Any suggestions on what may work best for this (I’m mindful of GB limitations etc.)? 

In terms of look and feel these competitor websites are the ones I like most right now - https://www.enjoyeducation.co.uk/ and https://goldencircletutors.co.uk/guidance/ - hopefully it’s helpful in terms of design direction. I can obviously be more specific though, so let me know if there are particular questions/options you’d like me to respond to. 

Thanks very much and speak soon,

Beth

WEDNESDAY 30TH JULY FEEDBACK:

GENERAL:
Brand colours are here: https://www.schemecolor.com/luxury-gold-blue.php and brand fonts are: Playfair Display (for headers) + Source Serif 4 (for body)
I have shared the final versions of the logo/banner to replace the placeholder ones currently up
Final videos versions now sent 

HOMEPAGE: 

First heading on this page should be ‘World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips’ please. (‘Founded on trust. Built on results…’ appears later, under ‘personally curated by Elizabeth Burrows’) 
Video above the fold should be the silent one please (and without text overlay) 
I think we can lose all the copy currently on top of the video (for over fifteen years…’. 
Shields for schools in media bundle sent via Swiss Transfer. Can we reverse text ‘we help student places at…’ to put it above the scrolling shields please?
‘Expert Private Tutoring, Personally Curated by Elizabeth Burrows’ section: 
can you bold ‘Cambridge-accepted educator and former Forbes journalist’, ‘Tatler’s Address Book’ ‘School Guide’s ‘Top Pick’. 
Change ‘today, the ethos…’ to ‘15 years later, the ethos…’
Can we include the actual brand logos for Tatler and School Guide UK please (instead of icons)? Can you add a crown with ‘Royal clientele’ also please. 
Maybe ‘Watch Introduction’ (please reword to ‘Meet Elizabeth’) should come under my pic? Rather than at the top of the page 
Perhaps the ‘who we support’ carousel would better spread across two lines? I imagine you’re still working on the layout, but on mobile it’s a bit crushy. One line is fine if it can look cleaner/more readable. Order should be: Primary, Secondary, Entrance Exams, Uni & Beyond, Online Homeschooling, SEN Support, London in-person
Royal Endorsement section - definitely want to highlight the fact I’ve worked with royalty, but it wasn’t actually the British royal family, so just need to be wary of saying ‘Britain’s most distinguished families’. Perhaps better to title it ‘Fit For a King’ and just include the actual royal testimonial with a crown icon? “Hi Elizabeth, I found out today that the two princes and the princess have all been offered places for next year. The family are delighted and would like me to pass on their sincerest thanks for all your hard work.”
‘Why Families Choose Us’ section - I like the animated gold sweeping across each section. I’ve changed some of the subheading/cut some copy for this section to make it punchier. Updated version to use is here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kf1eX7bFJ6UYjWwSMq5xcG50Lme2LsokbZC4OtncwsQ/edit?tab=t.0 
Results that Speak For Themselves (can the icons vary to reflect each different stat please?). I’ve changed some of the copy to: 500+ families we’ve successfully guided to academic excellence, 95% of 11+ candidates receive an offer from at least one of their top choices, with some students scoring in the top 2% of test takers, 94% of students improved by at least 2 grades at GCSE, -10% Elizabeth accepts less than 10% of tutors looking to work with us. 
Perhaps ‘Results that Speak for Themselves’ can sit higher up the page (above ‘Who We Support’?)
I wonder if ‘How It Works’ section can be cut from Homepage (as it’s all on the ‘How It Works’ page)?
Can ‘Client Reflections’ become ‘Success Stories’ please? Copy will need to change (feel free to take quotes from the Testimonials page)
Can the video of me introducing MPTO sit higher up and also say something like ‘Meet Elizabeth, Here to Help You Succeed’

HOW IT WORKS PAGE:
Copy after ‘How It Works’: ‘Our bespoke consultation and pairing process ensures an exceptional fit — and seamless support throughout the entire journey.’
02. Expert Tutor Matching copy: ‘Elizabeth has personally worked alongside the majority of tutors during her international career. New educators join us almost exclusively through trusted recommendations from existing team members. She interviews each tutor personally and accepts less than 10% of candidates.’ 
3. Tiered Tutoring Options. I’ve added a column with prices - please can you include (also change £47.50/hour to £45/hour). 
‘Why Families Choose Our Approach’ section. 3rd tick point change to ‘Tutors have hundreds to thousands of hours teaching experience’. Final tick point change to ‘Remarkable results. Our tutees secure top marks year in, year out’
Will ‘book consultation’ button lead to Calendly meeting booking option? 
Are you okay to add the three lines/sections of sample Tier 1, 2 and 3 tutors please? I am gathering photos of each of them and will send across as soon as I have all. 

ABOUT US PAGE:

Change ‘About Our Tutoring Excellence’ to ‘About Our Founder and Ethos’ 
‘Dedicated to Academic Success’ change to ‘An Unconventional Founder, Unparalleled Results’
New copy for this paragraph: ‘Our Founder Elizabeth did not follow the usual path and her company does not get the usual results. It surpasses them. With over 15 years of experience and a tutoring network that spans the globe, Elizabeth leads a team that helps students thrive — not just by raising grades, but by cultivating confidence, sharpening clarity and championing individual choice.’
- ‘100% Oxbridge tutors’ change to ‘94% GCSE students increasing by two grades or more’
- Can we flip the Ethos and Founder sections, so lead with Founder story please
- Founder section: remove highlights from under my name (it’s all mentioned in the Founder story copy that should follow, so may be plot spoilers!)
- Can you replace the copy under ‘Elizabeth Burrows’ with the Founder’s Story here please: “
Meet Elizabeth, A Different Kind of Educator
Considering how unconventional my own schooling was, I often find myself chuckling that I’m in my second decade of a career in education. My path through school wasn’t linear; I think that’s one of the reasons families trust me. I’m motivated by helping children when it feels like there are no straight lines, only a confusing jumble of squiggles. That’s when my team and I can make a real impact. 
I moved through six different schools growing up, across private, state, faith, co-educational and single-sex systems (including a boys’ school run by monks — yes, really). My learning could have easily suffered, especially since I have Dyspraxia, but one constant made a huge difference: my tutor. She not only gave me academic consistency but something far more valuable — a quiet confidence and the belief that excellence was achievable, even in turbulent times.
Going Against the Grain
By Sixth Form, I was achieving top grades. I hadn’t planned to apply to Oxbridge, but when my headmistress pulled me aside to ask if I’d considered it, something inside me switched on. I loved a challenge, and applying to Cambridge to read English and Theatre with Education Studies was certainly that.
But my offer letter was as much cause for agitation as celebration. You see, I had already fallen in love with another course and city: Bristol. My elder sister was studying languages there and although I had doggedly courted a Cambridge offer, I hadn’t considered a world in which I would actually receive one. What to do? Who turns down Cambridge? 17 year-old me. It was an agonizing decision, but even then I knew the right one. Looking back, I realise that dilemma helped define my ethos towards education: work as hard as you can to give yourself the luxury of choice, then have the confidence to pick what’s right for you — even if it’s not what’s expected.
First Lesson to Seventh Continent
I started tutoring at Bristol; it was love at first lesson. I’ve always had a natural affinity with children and combining that with academics just made sense. I went on to complete my Masters, all the while refining my tutoring practice, both in person and online. I quickly found myself being recommended from family to family.
What followed was a series of international placements and the opportunities to work with VIPs and private families around the world. By 2017, I had visited all seven continents. Along the way, I met and worked alongside some truly exceptional educators — many of whom are still firm favourites in the tutoring team now.
A Global View of What Education Can Do
Keen to put my English degree to good use, during this time I also worked at Forbes Middle East as Online Editor. I covered a range of subjects, including education. Conducting interviews with business moguls and CEOs reinforced what I already knew: the right educational support doesn’t just help people ace exams — it shapes their choices, their confidence and their future. These leaders had turned their fortunes around through education. What could be more exciting and important?
Results That Matter
Since founding My Private Tutor Online more than 15 years ago, I’ve helped hundreds of families through key academic transitions — from early entrance exams to Oxbridge interviews, international moves to last-minute GCSE turnarounds.
Each year, our students go on to achieve outstanding results:
Offers from Oxford and Cambridge


Placing in the top 2% of candidates at top five UK independent schools, including Eton, St. Paul’s, and Westminster


94% of GCSE students improve by two grades or more


Tutoring isn’t just about good grades. It’s about having someone in your corner who sees what you’re capable of, even before you do. That’s the kind of guidance I had growing up, and it’s what I aim to offer every family who works with us.
If you're looking for more than a tutor — if you’re seeking a trusted partner to help navigate the terrain, whether calm or chaotic — I’d love to hear from you.
Elizabeth Burrows, Founder & CEO


I think it would be good to please embed the recording of the interview I did here on Unlocking Academic Success Seminar: https://www.myprivatetutoronline.com/videomasterclasses 
”
- Add signature after story and embed video of me being interviewed. Subheading for it: With over 15 years of experience, Elizabeth is interviewed on how to use private tuition strategically to drive outstanding academic performance.

SUBJECT TUITION PAGE: 
- I think there’s quite a bit of info/copy still to be added from here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bljtPzYwot6aoIOC2LBXt1rj4R2qb39aDCDYDiSKcf8/edit?tab=t.0. I’m guessing what’s live on the site now is the central spine for the tuition page and that each subcategory (primary, secondary, entrance exams, University & Beyond, Homeschooling, SEN and London in-person) will become its own page when you click on a relevant button?
- 95% Schools Application Success Rate
- Change ‘24/7 support available’ to ‘3 Tiers of Specialist Support’
- Remove ‘Study Center Sessions’ from drop down ‘in person tutoring’ options. 

VIDEO MASTERCLASSES PAGE:

Just a note to please include the info about the recordings being from audiences of international students/Mandarin subtitles in the British Culture series masterclasses (copy for this page is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKWPNWFdlcrTg8HBHHYEXfunIsjFpombJOHOZ7b0wUs/edit?tab=t.0)



FAQS PAGE:

Please can you add the tiers/pricing table from ‘How It Works’ as the answer to ‘how much does tutoring cost’
Please change £200 to £300 (‘how do we pay and when’ answer)



PLEASE REMOVE: 
Any references to me being an Oxford graduate (on the ‘About Us’ page in Meet Our Founder section). You can change it to ‘Cambridge-accepted’ please. 
‘With over a decade of experience’ can change to ‘with over 15 years’ (on ‘About Us’ section) 
‘100% Oxbridge Tutors’. Not all tutors are Oxbridge grads. 













		 	 	 		
			
				
					
MONDAY 4TH AUGUST: 
Website Development Questions for Beth Quick Summary of Key Decisions Needed
					
The questions below require your input. Each topic is explained in detail further down with visual examples to help you decide.
					
Hero Section & Main Heading
					
1. Should the hero section fill the entire screen height when visitors first arrive? 2. Confirm "World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips" as the main headline?
					
Meet Elizabeth Video Section
					
1. Where would you prefer the introduction video to appear?
 2. Should we have the video in multiple locations or just one primary spot?
					
Who We Support Section
					
1. Which specific images would you like for each of the seven service categories?
					
Royal Endorsement
					
1. How prominently should the royal endorsement be featured on the homepage?
					
Client Testimonials
					
1. Should we streamline the testimonials section to focus on quality over quantity?
					
HERO SECTION
					
This is the first thing visitors see when they arrive on your website. Ignore the current formatting, ie the headings etc.
				
			
			 			 			 			 		
		
			
				
					
Option 1: Full-Screen Hero Section
					
Should the hero section fill the entire screen when visitors first arrive? This creates maximum impact but requires users to scroll to see additional content.
					
Full-Screen Example:
					
Option 2: Partial Hero Section
					
Alternatively, we could make it smaller (similar to Ivy Education's approach) so visitors immediately see the school credentials and scrolling university logos below.
					
Partial View Example:
				
			
			 			 		
		
			 			 			
				
					
Main Heading Confirmation
					
You mentioned: "First heading on this page should be 'World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips'" Just to confirm: You want this as the large text overlay on the video background in the hero section, correct?
The ‘World-Class Education…’ is actually in the video that will run in the background, so we can lose having it as a text overlay. 
					
(The "Founded on trust. Built on results..." text would then appear later in the Elizabeth Burrows introduction section) 
Can we change ‘Founded on…’ to ‘World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips’ (it can also replace ‘Expert Private Tutoring, Personally Curated by Elizabeth Burrows’)

					
MEET ELIZABETH VIDEO SECTION
					
Where should visitors be able to watch your introduction video?
					
Current Situation
					
You mentioned: "Maybe 'Watch Introduction' (please reword to 'Meet Elizabeth') should come under my pic? Rather than at the top of the page"
					
Two Possible Approaches:
 Option A: Video Only Under Your Photo
					
• Remove the video button from the hero section entirely
 • Visitors click "Meet Elizabeth" under your photo to watch the introduction • More streamlined hero section
					
Option B: Video in Both Locations (Recommended)
					
• Keep video button in hero section for immediate engagement
 • Also add "Meet Elizabeth" button under your photo (links to About page) • Gives visitors multiple ways to learn about you
					
Layout Example: (Your photo would be on the right instead of these white boxes, with a "Meet Elizabeth" button either under your photo, or at the end of the text like in the example) Are you able to keep the button as a thumbnail from the actual intro video (same as it currently is with ‘94% of our students improved...’ displaying)? Thanks
				
			
			 			 		
		
			 			
				
					
Which approach do you prefer?
 WHO WE SUPPORT SECTION
					
This section showcases your seven different service categories
					
Image Selection Needed
					
Could you please specify which images you'd like for each of these seven categories:
					
1. Primary School Support 

 2. Secondary School Support 

3. Entrance Exam Preparation
 
4. University & Beyond

 5. Online Homeschooling

 6. SEN Support

 7. London In-Person Tutoring - I couldn’t save it as a JPEG/PNG file, but this one you’ve already got in the carousel works well thanks

					
Note: I'll also improve the mobile layout for this section.
					
ROYAL ENDORSEMENT SECTION
					
How prominently should we feature your royal family testimonial?
				
			
			 			 			 			 		
		
			
				
					
(Again, ignore styling)
				
			
			
				
					
Option A: Large Featured Section
					
Make royal endorsement a major focal point by expanding the existing testimonials section:
				
			
			 			
				
					
Option B: Elegant Compact Section (Recommended)
					
Create a refined, understated section that includes a "Read Testimonials" button, similar to "A Word from Elizabeth" - prominent enough to be noticed but tastefully integrated:
				
			
			 		
		
			
				
					
Which style better reflects the discretion and prestige you want to convey? Option B please
				
			
			 			 			
				
					
HOW IT WORKS SECTION Status: Removed from Homepage
					
This section has been removed from the homepage to avoid duplication, as the content is already covered comprehensively on the dedicated "How It Works" page.
					
RESULTS THAT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES Status: Being Repositioned
					
This section will be moved higher up the page for greater impact. The styling is being updated to work with the new layout.
					
TESTIMONIALS SECTION STRATEGY
					
Should we streamline the testimonials for maximum impact?
					
Recommended Approach: sure, thanks for the suggestion and happy to go with it. The testimonials text will need changing at some point please. You can use the ones from the opening silent video (below) and/or the current testimonials page here. Thanks

QUOTE
'The world of tutoring is a minefield but your tutors are next level.' Mr & Mrs Li, Hong Kong

'It's a full house - offers from St Pauls, Westminster, Highgate and UCS. We can't believe it!' Mr & Mrs Hawthorne, Kensington



'Brian and Gloria's teaching style is just right - not lecturing but engaging and really growing her enthusiasm for the subjects.' Ms Adebayo, New York



'Newsflash! Thanks to you Jake has jumped from a U to two marks off a B - incredible progress in just a month and he really believes he's capable again.' Mr & Mrs Meritt-Jones, Hampstead


'Annika scored a 7 in her GCSE retake. We are THRILLED. It's such an improvement on the 4 she got in the summer!' Mr Gupta, Bath
"My tutor David was amazing. He helped me craft a personal statement to stand out from the competition. He also coached me for the interview - I got an offer from Oxford!" - Aryan, Politics student at Oxford University 
logo and tagline appearing as if being typed (World-class education, at your fingertips)




 Instead of a large general testimonials section, we suggest:
				
			
			 			 			 			 			
				
					
						 							
Highlight the royal endorsement as your premium testimonial
 						
						 							
Add a "View All Success Stories" button that links to your dedicated testimonials
 						
					 				
			
			
				
					
page
 • Keep the homepage focused on the most impactful content
				
			
			
				
					
This approach:
					
• Reduces homepage clutter
 • Emphasises your most prestigious testimonial
 • Encourages visitors to explore more testimonials on the dedicated page
					
Do you agree with this streamlined approach? Yes, thanks
				
			
			 			 		
		
			
				
					
VIDEO POSITIONING & BUTTON TEXT
					
Please help clarify your request about video placement
					
Your Request:
					
"Can the video of me introducing MPTO sit higher up and also say something like 'Meet Elizabeth, Here to Help You Succeed'"
					
Current Status:
					
The introduction video is already positioned at the very top of the page (in the Hero section) with a video button.
					
Could you clarify: Are you referring to:
					
• Moving the video button higher within the Hero section itself? Good where it is and also featuring a link to it again lower down (near my pic) as previously suggested
 • Adding a different video placement elsewhere on the page?
 • Changing the button text to "Meet Elizabeth, Here to Help You Succeed"? • Something else entirely?
					
A screenshot or more specific description would help ensure I implement exactly what you have in mind.
					
LOGO ENHANCEMENT
					
The Issue:
					
The original logo wasn't visible against the video background when the page first loads:
				
			
			 			 		
		
			 			
				
					
The Solution:
					
Created a white version of the logo for better visibility on the hero section:
				
			
			 			
				
					
Smart Transition:
					
When visitors scroll down to the white background sections, the logo automatically switches back to the standard version:
				
			
		
		
			 			
				
					
This ensures optimal visibility and brand consistency throughout the browsing experience.  Great, thanks for finding this fix.
				
			
		


TUESDAY 5TH AUGUST FEEDBACK:


GENERAL:
The Blog page is missing at the moment. Are you okay to use the content on the current page (except the top 10 tips article) to create it? Thank you 
Can I check that the font is Playfair Display (for headers) + Source Serif 4 (for body) please?
Some buttons are clickable but not linked to anywhere. I assume any ‘start your journey’ type buttons would link to the Bizstim enquiry form and ‘speak with Elizabeth’ type buttons to a Calendly call scheduling option? 
Can we have ‘About Us’ first on the navigation panel, then How it Works, Subject Tuition etc.
I’ve explained this lower down, but I think it would be good to have drop down subsections on the navigation menu. I.e. under ‘About Us’ having options for ‘Meet Elizabeth’, ‘Testimonials’ and ‘Our Ethos’. They may ultimately lead to the same page, but would be good to subdivide the section so parents can more easily find the bit they’re looking for. I hope that makes sense? 
I’m sending a SwissTransfer across with two additional videos that I’d like added please - one on the video masterclasses page and one for both the Subject Tuition and 11+ bootcamp pages please.

HOMEPAGE: 

Is it possible to make the My Private Tutor Online logo bigger on the navigation panel please?
I just realised there isn’t a testimonial video anywhere… are you able to drop the ‘parents testimonials’ video wherever you think appropriate please?
I can’t currently see the ‘Intro’ video (me talking) anywhere on the homepage?
Is it possible to speed up scrolling shields a bit? And ‘Kings College Westminster’ icon is appearing twice (please delete one)
‘Expert Private Tutoring, Personally Curated by Elizabeth Burrows’ section updated copy below (with bolded bits):

We provide exceptional tuition that helps students excel academically and thrive personally, opening doors to greater opportunities—at school and in life.

Founded in 2010 by Elizabeth Burrows—a Cambridge-accepted educator and former Forbes journalist— My Private Tutor Online began not as a business, but a trusted network of elite colleagues she met throughout her international tutoring career.

This circle of personal recommendations has evolved—organically and exclusively—into one of the UK's most respected names in specialist private tutoring. As testament, My Private Tutor Online is honoured to be featured in Tatler and recognised as School Guide's 'Top Pick' for private tuition.

15 years later, the ethos remains the same: every tutor is handpicked, every match thoughtfully made and every family accommodated directly by Elizabeth and her team.

Can the School Guide UK icon be bigger please?
Remove ‘Trusted by Royal Families • Featured in Tatler Address Book 2025’ 
Only use the crown icon next to relevant royal testimonial/royalty reference in the text
Can we add images to each of the ‘Results that Speak for Themselves’ boxes. I can select and send.
10% box text change: ‘Elizabeth accepts less than 10% of tutors looking to work with My Private Tutor Online’
Remove ‘Endorsed by Royal Families Worldwide’ and icon
Who We Support section: text change for Uni & Beyond (also sending replacement pic)
Complete UCAS support including Oxbridge admissions and course-specific tests i.e. UCAT and LNAT
London In-Person
Text change: London In-Person: Premium face-to-face tutoring sessions available across London
‘Why Families Choose Us’ section - 
Can the Royal testimonial be put on brand blue background and be in white writing, with the ‘Royal family representative’ in brand gold please. Like the Good Schools Guide on this page https://goldencircletutors.co.uk/ 
The blue font is a bit hard to read on top of the images (which I’ll be changing - will share new pics to swap in). After the sweep can you add a solid block colour (brand colour?) under the text so it’s easily readable please? 
Updated copy for these four blocks below: 
🤝 By Invitation Only
Elizabeth only works with educators she knows, has taught alongside or personally vetted. 
🎓 Exam Insight, from the Inside
Our Tier 1 tutors actually write/mark the real exams your child will take. Such insider perspective is rare and a distinct advantage in today's academic landscape.
👑 Fit For a King
Our services are trusted by prominent families, including VIPs and royalty.
🌍 Rooted in Britain, Appreciated Worldwide
We know British education inside and out and bring that knowledge to families across the globe.
Quote updated copy: “Parents come to us when something truly matters; they stay with us because we deliver real progress, quietly and expertly. This is not a tutoring directory. This is a bespoke service for ambitious families looking for trusted partners in their child's academic career.”
Thank you for adding the enquiry form, which looks great. Unfortunately, I need potential clients to complete an enquiry form that’s linked to my CRM platform, Bizstim, below. Are you able to sync your form up with Bizstim so it automatically absorbs data submitted? If not, can you include a picture of the Bizstim form and hyperlink it to take parents to the right page please? https://www.bizstim.com/inquiry/my-private-tutor-online/64fdd7e8febbf49c3f18ec855e7b1f02a7ad87311b0ede5991704ae603ed5fef6da333482f3c2ca69a6023d329ef65549ccabecc6bdc73a878e4f2141562cceb9uE20ScSAiO9T5yRIbx7FZ54JW5tLEWIl1aGPLme4-k~ 
Please remove the ‘visit us’ option from the footer, ‘24/7 response time’ under the email and the phone number can change to +44 7513 550278. Can you add a WhatsApp icon that’s clickable and opens a message on their whatsapp please? 

HOW IT WORKS PAGE:
Blue text readability issue - can you add colour block background? Or just have ‘World-class tutors. Expertly vetted…’ title over the image (which I’ll replace/send you new pic for) and the rest of the copy ‘At my private tutor online…’ underneath the image
Remove: Discover our proven 4-step process that has helped thousands of students achieve excellence. Continue reading to learn more
Copy after ‘How It Works’: ‘Our bespoke consultation and pairing process ensures an exceptional fit — and seamless support throughout the entire journey.’ (Instead of Our proven 4-step process ensures every student receives perfectly matched, expert tutoring support)
02. Expert Tutor Matching copy update: ‘Elizabeth has worked alongside the majority of tutors. New educators join us almost exclusively through recommendations from trusted team members. Elizabeth interviews each tutor personally and accepts less than 10% of candidates.’ 
3. Tiered Tutoring Options. Please change £47.50/hour to £45/hour.
Copy update: From essential support to premium elite guidance — all starting from just £45 per hour
Can we match the border colours to the level of tuition please? Tier 3 bronze, Tier 2 Silver and Tier 3 gold. Please add at the bottom of each option ‘From £45/hour’, ‘From £65/hour’ and ‘From £85/hour’ to each respectively.

Are you able to add the sample tutor profiles (3 at each tier) section please (copy here). If you think this would work better on another page to avoid overloading this one with content I’m open to it. Other natural option might be testimonials page? I am keen to show sample tutor profiles though somewhere. Thanks https://docs.google.com/document/d/15eA9fwsDPbPwXCfdEAv3ZAQ0SdT83fG1MHcJ_StrSC8/edit?tab=t.0 .

SUBJECT TUITION PAGE:
 
I’m sending a new video & thumbnail to be included in the ‘Entrance Exam’ section please. 
I’ll give you an image to go up top
Same copy readability issue. Maybe ‘Subject Tuition’ overlaid and ‘comprehensive educational support…’ underneath the image?
‘Three Tiers’ (rather than digit 3)
I think this page could do with some images. I’ll get some together and share
At the moment I don’t think the copy for this page I drafted (here:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bljtPzYwot6aoIOC2LBXt1rj4R2qb39aDCDYDiSKcf8/edit?tab=t.0 )  has been included. Please can you take the sections in purple for inclusion. On the menu navigation can we do drop down sub-sections under ‘Subject Tuition’ for the different major sections (Primary, Secondary, Entrance Exams, University & Beyond, Online Homeschooling, SEN & Neurodiverse and London In-Person) please? It can all link to the one page if you like, but would be good to separate it on the menu options. This could work well for some of the other pages too being subdivided on the navigation menu but actually linking to a single page (if you think that’s best): ‘How It Works’ and ‘About Us’ for example.

I’m motivated by helping children when it feels like there are no straight lines, only a confusing jumble of squiggles.
I loved a challenge, and applying to Cambridge to read English and Theatre with Education Studies was certainly that. But my offer letter was as much cause for agitation as celebration. 
I met and worked alongside some truly exceptional educators — many of whom are still firm favourites in the tutoring team now.
Conducting interviews with business moguls through Forbes reinforced that the right educational support doesn’t just help people ace exams — it shapes their choices, their confidence and their future.

ANYTHING IN PURPLE I’D LIKE INCLUDED PLEASE. GREEN CAN BE IGNORED. THANKS
Our tutors are examiners, school teachers, and subject specialists who are experienced educators but also motivating mentors.

🧒 PRIMARY
Bespoke one-to-one tuition for Reception to Year 6, focused on literacy, numeracy, reasoning, and building confidence through engaging, age-appropriate learning.
Preparation for 7+, 8+, 11+, Pre-test and CAT4 exams, including targeted practice, assessments, and mock interviews.

Early identification of learning shortcomings or support needs, with tailored, proactive plans to address them. The primary curriculum is the scaffolding upon which secondary success plays out; we’re passionate about plugging gaps and getting it right. We understand that early education experiences are formative, so we prioritise curiosity, resilience, and a love of learning.

Whether a child is progressing steadily or facing academic challenges, we provide gentle structure, consistency and expert encouragement. Every programme is tailored, and our team is on hand to advise on school options, testing timelines, or when extra support might be needed.

OUR ETHOS

Personalised. Empowering. World-Class.
At My Private Tutor Online, we believe that every child deserves an education tailored to who they are — not just where they’re expected to go. We meet each student where they are and help them build the confidence, curiosity and clarity to move forward with purpose.
We combine academic rigour with personal mentorship, recognising that long-term success depends as much on emotional resilience and self-belief as it does on subject mastery. 
Global Perspective, Local Sensitivity
With a team of world-class educators and experience spanning seven continents, we bring a truly global lens to tutoring. Families today are internationally mobile and often navigating multiple education systems. Our bespoke approach adapts to those complexities, offering structure, insight and flexibility.
Whether your child is preparing for the British school system, moving abroad, or sitting highly competitive exams, we help bridge the gap with confidence and clarity.
Supportive Guidance, Independent Growth
Great tutoring begins with trust. That’s why we take the time to understand your child — not just academically, but personally. We want to know what makes them tick so we can build a relationship where they feel seen, motivated, and empowered.
Our goal isn’t long-term dependence — it’s lasting confidence. We aim to become a victim of our own success: equipping students with the tools, strategies, and mindset to become independent learners. Tutoring should never be a crutch. We act as a guide and advocate during challenging moments, always with the aim of leading students back toward self-sufficiency.

HOW IT WORKS:

Outstanding Tuition. Tailored Pairing. Ongoing Guidance.
At My Private Tutor Online, we offer more than just tutoring—we provide thoughtful, expert advice at every stage of your child’s academic journey. Our service is consultative, personal, and bespoke to your family’s individual needs.
1. Initial Consultation
You begin with a one-to-one conversation with our Founder Elizabeth to understand your child’s academic profile, personality, and goals. This includes:
Subject strengths and areas for development


Upcoming exams or milestones


Preferred learning style


Any school-specific requirements


2. Expert Tutor Matching
With a tutoring career spanning continents and decades, Elizabeth came to know many of our tutors from working alongside them as colleagues. Elizabeth brings this deep personal and professional knowledge to every match, pairing students with not only a perfectly qualified tutor, but also a personality they will resonate well with. 
Elizabeth personally interviews every candidate, the majority of whom have come to us via personal recommendations from our existing team. She accepts fewer than 10% of applicants, selecting only those with an outstanding educational pedigree, impressive tutoring background and passion for nurturing young minds. 
Our tutors include:
Oxbridge alumni
Heads of Department at top 10 UK schools
Accredited GCSE, A Level and IB examiners
PhD and Postdocs


Each tutor has hundreds—if not thousands—of hours of teaching experience and an expert understanding of how to personalize the learning experience to tailor to the individual student. Our tutors undergo rigorous vetting, including enhanced DBS checks and reference requests, to ensure the highest standards of safety and integrity.
3. Tiered Tutoring Options
We offer a unique flexible tiered tutoring system, so you can choose the level of support that best fits your child’s needs and goals:

4. Insightful Progress Reports & Seamless Scheduling
To ensure meaningful progress, your tutor submits a detailed report after every lesson—including what was covered, homework assigned, and clear feedback on your child’s strengths and areas for development.
Each report combines quantitative ratings with qualitative insights, giving you a well-rounded view of your child’s performance. Reports are automatically emailed and available at any time via your secure login.
You’ll also receive automated lesson reminders 36 hours before each session, keeping everything running smoothly with minimal effort on your part.
5. Ongoing Support & Educational Partnership
At My Private Tutor Online, our commitment doesn’t end with a successful tutor match—it begins there. We offer ongoing, consultative support to ensure your child continues to thrive. Our highly responsive team is always available to assist, whether it’s rescheduling a session or tweaking lesson focus in light of a school report or parents’ evening feedback. We work closely with you to ensure each tutorial remains purposeful and aligned with your child’s evolving needs. 
Above all, we see tutoring as a long-term partnership. Many of our families remain with us for years, trusting us to guide their children through every stage—from foundational learning in the early years to university preparation and beyond. We offer more than just tutoring; we offer experienced expert educational guidance, tailored to the demands of modern family life.
And when you need us, we’re never far—just a call, message or email away.

ABOUT US

Meet Elizabeth, A Different Kind of Educator
Considering how unconventional my own schooling was, I often find myself chuckling that I’m in my second decade of a career in education. My path through school wasn’t linear; I think that’s one of the reasons families trust me. I’m motivated by helping children when it feels like there are no straight lines, only a confusing jumble of squiggles. That’s when my team and I can make a real impact. 
I moved through six different schools growing up, across private, state, faith, co-educational and single-sex systems (including a boys’ school run by monks — yes, really). My learning could have easily suffered, especially since I have Dyspraxia, but one constant made a huge difference: my tutor. She not only gave me academic consistency but something far more valuable — a quiet confidence and the belief that excellence was achievable, even in turbulent times.
Going Against the Grain
By Sixth Form, I was achieving top grades. I hadn’t planned to apply to Oxbridge, but when my headmistress pulled me aside to ask if I’d considered it, something inside me switched on. I loved a challenge, and applying to Cambridge to read English and Theatre with Education Studies was certainly that.
But my offer letter was as much cause for agitation as celebration. You see, I had already fallen in love with another course and city: Bristol. My elder sister was studying languages there and although I had doggedly courted a Cambridge offer, I hadn’t considered a world in which I would actually receive one. What to do? Who turns down Cambridge? 17 year-old me. It was an agonizing decision, but even then I knew the right one. Looking back, I realise that dilemma helped define my ethos towards education: work as hard as you can to give yourself the luxury of choice, then have the confidence to pick what’s right for you — even if it’s not what’s expected.
First Lesson to Seventh Continent
I started tutoring at Bristol; it was love at first lesson. I’ve always had a natural affinity with children and combining that with academics just made sense. I went on to complete my Masters, all the while refining my tutoring practice, both in person and online. I quickly found myself being recommended from family to family.
What followed was a series of international placements and the opportunities to work with VIPs and private families around the world. By 2017, I had visited all seven continents. Along the way, I met and worked alongside some truly exceptional educators — many of whom are still firm favourites in the tutoring team now.
A Global View of What Education Can Do
Keen to put my English degree to good use, during this time I also worked at Forbes Middle East as Online Editor. I covered a range of subjects, including education. Conducting interviews with business moguls and CEOs reinforced what I already knew: the right educational support doesn’t just help people ace exams — it shapes their choices, their confidence and their future. These leaders had turned their fortunes around through education. What could be more exciting and important?
Results That Matter
Since founding My Private Tutor Online more than 15 years ago, I’ve helped hundreds of families through key academic transitions — from early entrance exams to Oxbridge interviews, international moves to last-minute GCSE turnarounds.
Each year, our students go on to achieve outstanding results:
Offers from Oxford and Cambridge


Placing in the top 2% of candidates at top five UK independent schools, including Eton, St. Paul’s, and Westminster


94% of GCSE students improve by two grades or more


Tutoring isn’t just about good grades. It’s about having someone in your corner who sees what you’re capable of, even before you do. That’s the kind of guidance I had growing up, and it’s what I aim to offer every family who works with us.
If you're looking for more than a tutor — if you’re seeking a trusted partner to help navigate the terrain, whether calm or chaotic — I’d love to hear from you.
Elizabeth Burrows, Founder & CEO


I think it would be good to please embed the recording of the interview I did here on Unlocking Academic Success Seminar: https://www.myprivatetutoronline.com/videomasterclasses

❓ Other Questions
24. How are tutors selected and verified?
All our tutors come from the highest academic backgrounds, specialising in a full array of subjects at all levels. We work with a small group of highly trusted tutors from Elizabeth’s personal network and only actively seek out new tutors when our clients have specific needs. When we do look to introduce new educators to the pool they are carefully screened, DBS checked and personally interviewed by Elizabeth. Our recruitment process is in-depth; less than 10% of tutors who apply to our exclusive network are accepted.
25. Do you have a safeguarding policy?
Yes. Safeguarding is a top priority. All tutors are DBS-checked and our full safeguarding policy is available upon request.
26. What is your cancellation policy?
Lessons cancelled with more than 24 hours' notice incur no charge. Cancellations within 24 hours are charged in full.
We require a minimum of three weeks notice in writing to terminate regular tutoring arrangements. 
27. I have more questions. What should I do?
