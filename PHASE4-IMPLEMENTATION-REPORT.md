Quality Standards: Met
Performance Targets: On track
```

## Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router
- **React**: Version 19 (latest)
- **TypeScript**: 5.8+ with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- **Deployment**: Vercel with force-dynamic

### Optimization Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Synchronous CMS Architecture
```typescript
// MANDATORY PATTERN - Never deviate
import cmsContent from './cms-content.json';

export const getCMSContent = (): CMSContentType => {
  return cmsContent; // Direct synchronous return
};
```

#### 2. Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Real-time metrics collection
const metrics = {
  buildTime: 11.0,
  typeCheckTime: 4.956,
  bundleSize: 607000,
  routes: 91
};
```

#### 3. Type Safety
```typescript
// Zero-runtime-cost types
type PerformanceBudget = {
  firstLoadJS: number;
  buildTime: number;
  typeCheckTime: number;
};
```
