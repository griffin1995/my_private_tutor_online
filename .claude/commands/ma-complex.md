# Multi-Agent Analysis - Complex Mode

Execute comprehensive 6-agent analysis for complex architecture decisions and strategic initiatives.

## Usage

```bash
/ma-complex <task_description> [profile:balanced|realistic|debug]
```

## Configuration
- **Agents**: 6 specialist agents with deep domain expertise
- **Rounds**: 7 comprehensive rounds with extended debate
- **Duration**: 120-180 minutes
- **Model**: Opus (maximum capability)

## Enhanced Round Structure
1. **Domain Assessment**: Comprehensive analysis from all 6 specialists
2. **Solution Proposals**: Detailed implementation strategies
3. **Architecture Review**: Deep technical design evaluation
4. **Integration Analysis**: Complex cross-domain coordination
5. **Trade-off Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional decision analysis
6. **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive threat modeling
7. **Strategic Consensus**: Final unified strategy with implementation roadmap

## When to Use
- System architecture decisions
- Platform migrations
- Scalability planning
- Security implementations
- Business-critical features
- Multi-team coordination
- Technology stack decisions
- Performance optimization strategies

## Examples

```bash
/ma-complex "Design microservices architecture for 10x scale"
/ma-complex "Implement zero-trust security model" profile:realistic
/ma-complex "Migration strategy from monolith to distributed system"
/ma-complex "Real-time collaboration system architecture"
```

## Enhanced Deliverables
- **Comprehensive Technical Specification**: Complete system design
- **Detailed Implementation Roadmap**: Phase-by-phase execution plan
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Multi-layered security and reliability
- **Performance Optimization Plan**: Scalability and efficiency targets
- **Team Coordination Framework**: Resource allocation and dependencies
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Strategic value and competitive advantage
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Complete operational framework

## Success Criteria
- **Minimum 90% consensus** across all 6 agents
- **Complete 7-round execution** with extended deliberation
- **Enterprise-grade deliverables** suitable for board presentation
- **Implementation-ready specifications** with clear success metrics
