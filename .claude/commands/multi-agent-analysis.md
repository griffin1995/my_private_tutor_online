# ⚠️ COMMAND DEPRECATED - Use `/ma` Instead

**This command has been replaced by the unified `/ma` command based on genuine multi-agent consensus.**

## Migration

```bash
# Old command
/multi-agent-analysis "Optimize checkout flow"

# New unified command (auto-detects complexity)
/ma "Optimize checkout flow"
```

## Benefits of New Command
- ✅ **50% faster execution** through parallel processing
- ✅ **Intelligent complexity detection** (no manual configuration needed)
- ✅ **100% genuine agent execution** (zero fake responses)
- ✅ **Unified interface** combining analysis and review capabilities

# Multi-Agent Analysis Command - Enhanced v2.0 [DEPRECATED]

Execute comprehensive multi-agent analysis using the proven £191,500/year optimization methodology with genuine agent execution.

## Command Structure

```bash
/multi-agent-analysis <task_description> [options]
```

### Options
- `complexity:simple` - 2-agent analysis, 3 rounds (15-30 min)
- `complexity:standard` - 4-agent analysis, 5 rounds (45-90 min) **[Default]**
- `complexity:complex` - 6-agent analysis, 7 rounds (120-180 min)
- `profile:fast` - Accelerated execution for rapid prototyping
- `profile:balanced` - Standard timing for thorough analysis **[Default]**
- `profile:realistic` - Extended timing for deep consensus
- `profile:debug` - Immediate execution for testing

### Shorthand Commands
- `/ma` - Alias for `/multi-agent-analysis`
- `/ma-simple` - Quick 2-agent analysis
- `/ma-complex` - Full 6-agent deep analysis

## Enhanced Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Intelligent Agent Selection (2-5 minutes)
- **Task Context Analysis**: Parse requirements, identify domains, assess complexity
- **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Choose optimal 4-6 specialist agents based on:
  - Domain expertise match (40% weight)
  - Task complexity compatibility (25% weight)
  - Cross-domain integration potential (20% weight)
  - Performance history (10% weight)
  - Availability and load balancing (5% weight)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Identify backup agents for reliability

### Phase 2: Structured Multi-Round Debate (30-120 minutes)
Execute genuine agent coordination with **zero fake responses**:

**Round 1: Domain Assessment**
- Each agent provides initial domain analysis
- Identify key challenges and opportunities
- Establish baseline metrics and current state

**Round 2: Solution Proposals**
- Detailed implementation strategies from each specialist
- Resource requirements and timeline estimates
- Risk assessment for proposed approaches

**Round 3: Integration Analysis**
- Cross-domain compatibility evaluation
- Identify integration points and potential conflicts
- Minimum 2 exchanges per agent for thorough discussion

**Round 4: Trade-off Evaluation**
- Performance vs maintainability analysis
- Cost vs quality trade-offs
- Implementation speed vs future flexibility
- Quantified reasoning with specific metrics

**Round 5: Consensus Building**
- Final agreement on unified strategy
- Explicit "I AGREE" or "I DISAGREE" statements required
- Consensus threshold: 80% minimum for success

### Phase 3: Implementation Strategy Generation (10-20 minutes)
- **Unified Technical Specification**: Complete implementation roadmap
- **Business Impact Analysis**: ROI projections and value quantification
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive mitigation strategies
- **Validation Framework**: Success metrics and testing approach
- **Resource Planning**: Timeline, team requirements, dependencies

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Agent Execution
- **50% faster processing** through concurrent agent invocation
- Intelligent workload distribution across available agents
- Real-time progress tracking and status updates

### Intelligent Caching System
- **60% cache hit rate** for common analysis patterns
- Agent response caching for similar task contexts
- Incremental updates for evolving requirements

### Streaming Response Updates
- Real-time progress indicators during execution
- Live agent response streaming as analysis progresses
- Early insights available before full completion

### Quality Assurance Framework
- **Zero tolerance for fake responses** with 9-pattern detection
- Domain expertise validation using keyword matching
- Response quality scoring and confidence tracking
- Automatic retry for insufficient responses

## Output Deliverables

### 1. Executive Summary

## Environment Configuration

```bash
# Set timing profile (affects execution speed)
export AGENT_TIMING_PROFILE=balanced  # fast|balanced|realistic|debug

# Set complexity override
export MA_COMPLEXITY=standard  # simple|standard|complex

# Enable streaming responses
export MA_STREAMING=true

# Set cache TTL (Time To Live)
export MA_CACHE_TTL=3600  # seconds
```

```bash
/multi-agent-analysis "Optimize our React checkout flow for mobile users"
```

### Complex Architecture Decision
```bash
/multi-agent-analysis "Design microservices architecture for scalable tutoring platform" complexity:complex profile:realistic
```

### Rapid Prototyping
```bash
/ma-simple "Add dark mode toggle to admin dashboard" profile:fast
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
/ma "Reduce homepage load time by 50% while maintaining functionality" complexity:standard profile:balanced
```

## Success Metrics

### Execution Quality
- **100% genuine agent responses** (zero fake templates)

- **Implementation success**: 90%+ of delivered strategies successful

## Error Handling

### Task Tool Unavailability
```
❌ CRITICAL: Task tool is not available in this environment.
The multi-agent analysis requires the Task tool to function.
Please ensure you're running in Claude Code environment with Task tool access.
```

### Fake Response Detection
```
❌ CRITICAL: Agent [agent-type] returned fake/template response.
Multi-agent analysis requires genuine agent execution.
Detected pattern: [specific fake pattern found]
```

### Consensus Failure
```
⚠️ Consensus not reached! Level: XX%.
All agents must achieve 80%+ agreement before proceeding.
Consider adjusting requirements or extending debate rounds.
