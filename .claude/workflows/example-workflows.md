   - Reduces specialization benefits

2. **Specialists without context-manager (4+ agents)**
   - Communication breakdowns
   - Duplicate work and conflicts

3. **Security-critical work without security-auditor**
   - Higher vulnerability rates
   - Compliance failures

## 🎛️ Customizing Workflows

### Creating Custom Agent Combinations

```json
// Add to agent-capability-matrix.json
"agentCombinations": {
  "your-custom-workflow": [
    "primary-agent",
    "supporting-agent-1", 
    "supporting-agent-2"
  ]
}
```

### Workflow Templates

```bash
# Create reusable workflow template
./agent-manager.sh create template-name "Template description with specific requirements"

# Use context-manager to refine based on project needs
./agent-manager.sh assign template-name context-manager
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Analyze workflow performance
./agent-manager.sh performance

# Adjust agent selection based on historical success
# System automatically learns and improves recommendations
```
