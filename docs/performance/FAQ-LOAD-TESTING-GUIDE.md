```

## Real-time Performance Monitoring

### Performance Monitor Implementation

**Client-side Monitoring** (`performance-monitor.ts`):

- Web Vitals collection with FAQ context
- FAQ-specific performance tracking
- Assistive technology performance monitoring
- Real-time alerting for royal client issues
- Automatic performance data transmission

**Server-side Analytics** (`/api/analytics/performance`):

- Performance data validation and storage
- SLA compliance monitoring
- Alert generation for critical issues
- Aggregated performance analytics
- Historical trend analysis

### Monitoring Features

**Automatic Tracking**:

- Search response times
- Theme toggle performance
- Voice search processing
- Offline sync performance
- Accessibility navigation timing

**Alert Conditions**:

- Royal client SLA violations (>100ms response time)
- High error rates (>0.01% for royal clients)
- Poor Core Web Vitals scores
- Accessibility performance degradation
- System capacity threshold breaches

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Caching Strategy

**Multi-layer Caching**:

- **Browser Cache**: Static FAQ content with appropriate headers
- **CDN Cache**: Global FAQ content distribution
- **Application Cache**: Server-side FAQ data caching
- **Database Cache**: Optimized FAQ query caching

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// FAQ content caching with user-specific optimization
const cacheStrategy = {
	royal_clients: { ttl: 300, priority: 'high' }, // 5 minutes
	standard_clients: { ttl: 600, priority: 'medium' }, // 10 minutes
	accessibility: { ttl: 180, priority: 'high' }, // 3 minutes (frequent updates)
};
```

### 2. Database Optimization

**Query Optimization**:

- Indexed FAQ search fields
- Optimized category lookup queries
- Efficient full-text search implementation
- Connection pooling and query batching

**FAQ Search Index Strategy**:

```sql
-- Optimized FAQ search indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_faq_search_content ON faq_items USING gin(to_tsvector('english', content));
CREATE INDEX idx_faq_category_priority ON faq_items (category_id, priority DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_faq_user_type ON faq_items (user_type, created_at DESC);
```

### 3. Frontend Performance

**Code Splitting**:

- FAQ component lazy loading
- Search functionality on-demand loading
- Theme system dynamic imports
- Voice search feature conditional loading

**Bundle Optimization**:

```javascript
// Dynamic FAQ component loading
const FAQSearch = lazy(() => import('./components/FAQSearch'));
const VoiceSearch = lazy(() => import('./components/VoiceSearch'));
const AccessibilityTools = lazy(
	() => import('./components/AccessibilityTools'),
);
```

### 4. API Optimization

**Response Optimization**:

- Compressed API responses (gzip/brotli)
- Paginated FAQ results
- Minimal payload structures
- Conditional requests with ETags

**Search Performance**:

```typescript
// Optimized FAQ search implementation
async function searchFAQ(query: string, userType: string) {
	const cacheKey = `faq-search-${query}-${userType}`;

	// Check cache first
	const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);
	if (cached) return cached;

	// Execute search with user-specific optimization
	const results = await executeOptimizedSearch(query, userType);

	// Cache with appropriate TTL
	await cache.set(cacheKey, results, getCacheTTL(userType));

	return results;
}
```
