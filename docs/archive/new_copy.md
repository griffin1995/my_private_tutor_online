**JACK AND BETH - WEBSITE REFRESH**

Hi Jack,

I just wanted to share this Doc with you to use as a central point for coordinating the website refresh. I figure with different docs for each of the webpages it would be helpful to have one doc as an anchor point.

Here’s an updated sitemap. It may still change and I’ll of course let you know if it does. Pages in green I’ve drafted and sent you (copy may still change a bit, but central sections for each page are in place), pages in blue are yet to be created (hopefully within the next 48 hours ideally).

I expect we may need a shared folder for me to drop the images/videos etc. in for you to access. Any suggestions on what may work best for this (I’m mindful of GB limitations etc.)?

In terms of look and feel this competitor website is the one I like most right now - <https://www.enjoyeducation.co.uk/> - hopefully it’s helpful in terms of design direction. I can obviously be more specific though, so let me know if there are particular questions/options you’d like me to respond to.

Thanks very much and speak soon,

Beth

**OUR ETHOS**

**Personalised. Empowering. World-Class.**

At My Private Tutor Online, we believe that every child deserves an education tailored to who they are — not just where they’re expected to go. Our Founder Elizabeth didn’t walk a conventional education path and we don’t expect our tutees to either. Instead, we meet each student where they are and help them build the confidence, curiosity and clarity to move forward with purpose.

We combine academic rigour with personal mentorship, recognising that long-term success depends as much on emotional resilience and self-belief as it does on subject mastery.

**Global Perspective, Local Sensitivity**

With a team of world-class educators and experience spanning seven continents, we bring a truly global lens to tutoring. Families today are internationally mobile and often navigating multiple education systems. Our bespoke approach adapts to those complexities, offering structure, insight and flexibility.

Whether your child is preparing for the British school system, moving abroad, or sitting highly competitive exams, we help bridge the gap with confidence and clarity.

**Supportive Guidance, Independent Growth**

Great tutoring begins with trust. That’s why we take the time to understand your child — not just academically, but personally. We want to know what makes them tick so we can build a relationship where they feel seen, motivated, and empowered.

Our goal isn’t long-term dependence — it’s lasting confidence. We aim to become a victim of our own success: equipping students with the tools, strategies, and mindset to become independent learners. Tutoring should never be a crutch. We act as a guide and advocate during challenging moments, always with the aim of leading students back toward self-sufficiency.

**Our results speak for themselves:**

Consistent offers from Oxford and Cambridge

Top 2% placements at elite UK independent schools, with 95% of tutees securing an offer from at least one of their desired schools

94% of GCSE students improving by two or more grades

Let us help your child find their path — and the courage to walk it with confidence.

**HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Your journey to academic success**

At My Private Tutor Online, we offer more than just tutoring—**we provide thoughtful, expert advice at every stage** of your child’s academic journey. Our service is **consultative, personal, and bespoke** to your family’s individual needs.

### **1\. Initial Consultation**

You begin with a one-to-one conversation with our Founder Elizabeth to understand your child’s academic profile, personality, and goals. This includes:

- Subject strengths and areas for development

- Upcoming exams or milestones

- Preferred learning style

- Any school-specific requirements

### **2\. Expert Tutor Matching**

With a tutoring career spanning continents and decades, **Elizabeth came to know many of our tutors from working alongside them as colleagues**. Elizabeth brings this deep personal and professional knowledge to every match, pairing students with not only a perfectly qualified tutor, but also a personality they will resonate well with.

Elizabeth **personally interviews every candidate,** the majority of whom have come to us via personal recommendations from our existing team. She accepts **fewer than 10% of applicants**, selecting only those with an outstanding **educational pedigree, impressive tutoring background and passion for nurturing young minds**.

Our tutors include:

- **Oxbridge alumni**
- **Heads of Department** at top 10 UK schools
- **Accredited GCSE, A Level and IB examiners**
- **PhD and Postdocs

Our highly responsive team is always available to assist, whether it’s rescheduling a session or tweaking lesson focus in light of a school report or parents’ evening feedback. We work closely with you to ensure each tutorial remains purposeful and aligned with your child’s evolving needs.

Above all, we see tutoring as a long-term partnership. Many of our families remain with us for years, trusting us to guide their children through every stage—from foundational learning in the early years to university preparation and beyond.
