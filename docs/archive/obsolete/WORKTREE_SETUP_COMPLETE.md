## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Worktree
```bash
# Recommended first worktree for testing
./.claude/scripts/create-worktree.sh feature-cms-enhancement content-specialist "Improve CMS admin interface for non-technical users"
```

### 2. Check Status
```bash
# View all worktrees
./.claude/scripts/worktree-status.sh

# Check project context
node ./.claude/scripts/update-context.js status
```

### 3. Start Working
```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd /home/jack/Documents/mpto-worktrees/feature-cms-enhancement

# Review briefing
cat .agent-briefing.md
```

## üé≠ Agent Coordination Pattern

### Context Manager (Main Repo)
- **Location**: `/home/jack/Documents/my_private_tutor_online`
- **Role**: Coordinate all worktrees, manage integrations, track dependencies
- **Tools**: Status monitoring, context management, integration planning

### Specialized Agents (Worktrees)
- **Location**: `/home/jack/Documents/mpto-worktrees/[worktree-name]`
- **Role**: Focus on specific expertise area within assigned worktree
- **Briefing**: Each worktree contains `.agent-briefing.md` with context and constraints

---

## üí° Key Benefits Unlocked

1. **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously without branch switching
2. **Agent Specialization**: Each worktree can have dedicated expert agents
3. **Context Preservation**: Central manager maintains project-wide coherence
4. **Reduced Conflicts**: Isolated development environments minimize merge issues
5. **Faster Iteration**: No need to stash/commit when switching between features

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Initial Worktrees

Based on the MPTO project needs:

### High Priority
1. **feature-cms-enhancement** (content-specialist)
   - Improve admin interface usability
   - Better content validation and error messages
   - Enhanced image management workflow

2. **opt-performance** (performance-engineer)
   - Meet Core Web Vitals targets (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
   - Optimize bundle size (<150kB gzipped)
   - Improve loading performance

### Medium Priority
3. **feature-booking-system** (backend-developer)
   - Calendly integration for consultations
   - Payment processing system
   - Booking workflow optimization

4. **bugfix-safari-compatibility** (frontend-developer)
   - Safari video playback issues
   - Cross-browser compatibility fixes
   - Mobile Safari optimizations

5. **opt-accessibility** (accessibility-specialist)
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit
   - Screen reader optimization
   - Keyboard navigation improvements

## üéØ Workflow Example

### Context Manager Creates Worktree
```bash
# In main repository
./.claude/scripts/create-worktree.sh feature-cms-enhancement content-specialist "Improve CMS admin interface"
```

### Content Specialist Takes Over
```bash
# Open new Claude Code session in worktree
cd /home/jack/Documents/mpto-worktrees/feature-cms-enhancement

# Brief the agent:
# "I'm acting as the content-specialist for the feature-cms-enhancement worktree.
# Please review .agent-briefing.md and begin improving the CMS admin interface."
```

### Context Manager Monitors Progress
```bash
# Regular status checks from main repo
./.claude/scripts/worktree-status.sh
node ./.claude/scripts/update-context.js status
```

### Integration When Ready
```bash
# From worktree: test and sync
npm run build && npm run test
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master

# From main repo: merge
git checkout master && git merge feature-cms-enhancement
node ./.claude/scripts/update-context.js update-status feature-cms-enhancement completed
```

## üîß Management Commands

```bash
# Create worktree with agent assignment
./.claude/scripts/create-worktree.sh <name> <agent> "<description>"

# Monitor all worktrees
./.claude/scripts/worktree-status.sh

# Update project context
node ./.claude/scripts/update-context.js status

# Remove completed worktree
git worktree remove ../mpto-worktrees/<name>
node ./.claude/scripts/update-context.js remove-worktree <name>

# Sync worktree with main
cd ../mpto-worktrees/<name>
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master
```

## ‚ö° Next Steps

1. **Test the Workflow**: Create the recommended CMS enhancement worktree
2. **Validate Agent Coordination**: Use multiple Claude Code sessions to test coordination
3. **Scale Up**: Add performance optimization and booking system worktrees
4. **Monitor Success**: Track parallel development efficiency and context preservation

---

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know the workflow is successful when you achieve:
- ‚úÖ Multiple features developing in parallel
- ‚úÖ Specialized agents working efficiently in their domains
- ‚úÖ Minimal merge conflicts due to isolation
- ‚úÖ Maintained project coherence across all workstreams
- ‚úÖ Faster iteration without branch switching overhead
