You are implementing critical improvements to the Subject Tuition page for My Private Tutor Online, a premium tutoring service with royal endorsements. This task requires three
  focused enhancements: typography fixes, video integration, and lead generation form implementation.

  PROJECT CONTEXT:
  - Stack: Next.js 15.4.6 App Router, React 19, TypeScript 5.8.3+, Tailwind CSS 4.x
  - Current page: /src/app/subject-tuition/page.tsx with nested dropdown navigation
  - Standards: Royal client quality, British English, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
  - Documentation: Context7 MCP exclusive (mandatory for ALL changes)

  TASK 1: TYPOGRAPHY FIX - GOLD QUOTATION MARKS
  Current Issue: Closing quotation marks in testimonials are being cut off or appearing on wrong lines
  Required Actions:
  1. Inspect the gold quotation mark implementation in subject-tuition page
  2. Identify CSS/layout issues causing text wrapping problems
  3. Fix positioning to ensure closing quotes appear at proper line height
  4. Maintain existing gold color (#eab308) and visual styling
  5. Test across viewport sizes to ensure consistent rendering

  Implementation Requirements:
  - Use Context7 documentation for CSS-in-JS patterns
  - Add source comments: // CONTEXT7 SOURCE: [library] - Typography positioning fix
  - Preserve existing testimonial content and structure
  - Ensure quotes remain semantically correct (using proper UTF-8 characters)

  TASK 2: VIDEO INTEGRATION - UCAS MASTERCLASS THUMBNAIL
  Section: "University and Beyond" on Subject Tuition page
  Required Actions:
  1. Locate the UCAS masterclass video reference in the section
  2. Add video thumbnail component with proper aspect ratio (16:9)
  3. Implement click handler to navigate to masterclasses page UCAS section
  4. Source thumbnail from /public/videos/ or appropriate CMS location
  5. Add loading state and error handling for thumbnail

  Implementation Pattern:
  ```typescript

  <div className="relative aspect-video cursor-pointer group">
    <Image
      src={cmsImages.ucasMasterclassThumbnail}
      alt="UCAS Masterclass Preview"
      fill
      className="object-cover rounded-lg"
      onClick={() => router.push('/masterclasses#ucas-section')}
    />
    <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/20 group-hover:bg-black/40 transition-colors rounded-lg" />
    <PlayCircleIcon className="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-16 h-16 text-white opacity-90 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity" />
  </div>

    acceptPrivacyPolicy: boolean;
  }

  const leadSchema = z.object({
    email: z.string().email("Please enter a valid email address"),
    firstName: z.string().min(2, "First name must be at least 2 characters"),
    consentToMarketing: z.boolean(),
