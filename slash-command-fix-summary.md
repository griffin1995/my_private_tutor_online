# Slash Command Fix Summary - September 17, 2025

## Issue Resolution
Successfully debugged and implemented the missing `/start` and `/save` slash commands for Claude Code.

## Commands Created

### 1. `/start` Command
**Location**: `/home/jack/Documents/my_private_tutor_online/.claude/commands/start.md`
**Purpose**: Start a new development session or project task
**Features**:
- Accepts task description or project name as arguments
- Uses Read and Task tools for project understanding
- Follows structured approach with planning and execution phases
- Integrates with project's CLAUDE.md context

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
/start implement user authentication
/start fix homepage loading issue
/start add new payment gateway
```

### 2. `/save` Command
**Location**: `/home/jack/Documents/my_private_tutor_online/.claude/commands/save.md`
**Purpose**: Save current work progress with git commit
**Features**:
- Dynamic git status integration using bash prefix (`!`)
- Shows current changes and recent commits
- Accepts commit message as argument
- Follows Conventional Commits format
- Includes session documentation capability

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
/save fix: resolve slash command execution issues
/save feat: add user profile management
/save docs: update API documentation
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Structure (Following Claude Code Official Docs)
Both commands follow the official Claude Code slash command pattern:
1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Defines metadata including allowed tools, description, and model
2. **Dynamic Context**: Uses `!` prefix for bash command execution
3. **Argument Handling**: Uses `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for user input
4. **Source Attribution**: Includes Context7 MCP documentation references

### File Format
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: [tool list]
description: Command description
argument-hint: [expected arguments]
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---
```

## Testing & Verification
✅ Commands created in correct directory: `.claude/commands/`
✅ Proper YAML frontmatter format verified
✅ No conflicting personal commands in `~/.claude/commands/`
✅ File permissions correct (644)
✅ Context7 source attribution included

## How to Use These Commands

1. **Starting a New Task**:
   ```bash
   /start [your task description]
   ```
   This will initialize a development session with proper context and planning.

2. **Saving Your Work**:
   ```bash
   /save [your commit message]
   ```
   This will review changes, stage files, and create a descriptive git commit.

## Additional Commands Available
The project also has these slash commands configured:
- `/ma` - Multi-agent analysis with intelligent complexity detection
- `/fix-issue` - Fix specific issues following coding standards
- `/multi-agent-review` - Comprehensive multi-agent code review
- `/optimize` - Performance optimization analysis
- `/security-review` - Security vulnerability assessment
- `/test-build` - Run tests and build verification

## Next Steps
The slash commands are now properly configured and ready to use. They follow the official Claude Code documentation patterns and integrate with the project's existing workflow and standards.
