### Bundle Composition Breakdown
```
✅ Shared Chunks Strategy (704kB base):
├── chunks/npm.next-cd1ca9d794d56e93.js          53.2kB (Next.js runtime)
├── chunks/vendors-6391b56b-07549f0b02358244.js  24.7kB (Core React libraries)
├── chunks/common-c3e87f8f-40fec3bc67cf4875.js   25.4kB (Shared components)
├── other shared chunks (total)                   356kB (UI/animation libraries)
└── vendor chunks (18 optimized modules)         244.7kB (Third-party optimized)

✅ Page-Specific Bundles:
├── / (Homepage)           334B + 699kB shared = 699.3kB total
├── /testimonials         25.1kB + 724kB shared = 749.1kB total
├── /faq                  16.9kB + 716kB shared = 732.9kB total
└── Other pages          <10kB each + shared cache benefit
```
