Following the first lesson, Clients must maintain a minimum positive account balance of £300 as standard. This balance serves as credit on the account and will be deducted from the final invoice when tuition ends.

Following the first prepaid session, tuition is billed monthly in arrears, with payment due immediately upon receipt of the invoice.

MPTO reserves the right to suspend tuition until full payment (including interest) is received.

All payments must be made by bank transfer to MPTO.

The Client is responsible for all bank transfer charges or international payment fees.

Interest and suspension terms are as referenced in Clause 2.4.

In the event of non-payment, MPTO will pass the matter to Creditreform for recovery.

Creditreform may add additional charges to recover outstanding fees.
