**Business Risk**: EXTREME

**Required Investment**: £50,000-100,000

## Conclusion

My Private Tutor Online faces critical safeguarding deficiencies that pose immediate risks to child safety and business continuity. The absence of basic safeguarding infrastructure is incompatible with the premium positioning and royal endorsements.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: The business must treat safeguarding as the absolute top priority, above all commercial considerations. Failure to implement comprehensive safeguarding measures within the next 30 days could result in regulatory intervention, criminal liability, and complete business failure.

The reputation built over 15 years and royal endorsements could be destroyed by a single safeguarding incident. Investment in comprehensive safeguarding is not optional—it is essential for survival.
