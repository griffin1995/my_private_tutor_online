## üö® CRITICAL DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

### High-Severity Discrepancies (>25% Variance)
```typescript
CRITICAL GAPS IN FIRST LOOP ASSESSMENT:

1. DEPENDENCY COUNT DISCREPANCY (+29%):
   First Loop: 161 dependencies
   Reality: 207 dependencies  
   Impact: SEVERE - budget and performance calculations invalid
   Root Cause: Incomplete dependency analysis

2. COMPONENT COUNT DISCREPANCY (+55%):
   First Loop: "200+ components"
   Reality: 310 TSX files
   Impact: HIGH - complexity and maintenance underestimated
   Root Cause: Surface-level component counting

3. PERFORMANCE BUDGET VIOLATION (57% over):
   First Loop: "Performance Excellence" 
   Reality: 705 KB vs 450 KB target
   Impact: CRITICAL - revenue and client experience at risk
   Root Cause: Lack of actual bundle analysis

4. MEMORY MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT:
   First Loop: Not assessed
   Reality: CONCERNING unbounded buffers
   Impact: HIGH - mobile experience and long sessions at risk
   Root Cause: Component-level analysis not performed
```

### Medium-Severity Discrepancies (10-25% Variance)
```typescript
MODERATE GAPS IDENTIFIED:

1. BUNDLE SIZE VARIANCE (+2-21%):
   First Loop: 690 KB estimate
   Reality: 705-835 KB measured
   Impact: MODERATE - performance calculations slightly off
   Root Cause: Estimation vs measurement

2. PERFORMANCE MONITORING ASSESSMENT:
   First Loop: "WORLD-CLASS"
   Reality: Good but with performance overhead concerns
   Impact: MODERATE - monitoring may affect measurements
   Root Cause: Insufficient analysis of monitoring overhead
```
