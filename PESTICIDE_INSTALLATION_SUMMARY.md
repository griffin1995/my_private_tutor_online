## Safety Features ‚ú®

### Production Protection
- ‚úÖ **Environment Checks**: Never loads in production
- ‚úÖ **Conditional Rendering**: Component returns null in production
- ‚úÖ **Zero Impact**: No production bundle size increase
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Disable**: Production builds ignore all Pesticide code

### Development Features
- ‚úÖ **Hot Toggle**: Enable/disable without page reload
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators when active
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access with Ctrl+Alt+P
- ‚úÖ **Helper Classes**: Special debugging classes available

## Development Workflow Integration

### For Layout Debugging
1. Enable Pesticide via any method above
2. Navigate to the page with layout issues
3. Observe element boundaries and structure
4. Use helper classes for specific elements:
   ```html
   <div class="pesticide-debug">Problem element</div>
   <div class="pesticide-highlight">Important element</div>
   <div class="pesticide-warn">Attention needed</div>
   ```

### For Component Development
1. Start dev server with Pesticide enabled
2. Build your component structure
3. Toggle Pesticide to see visual boundaries
4. Refine layout based on visual feedback

### For Team Debugging
1. Team member reports layout issue
2. Enable Pesticide: `npm run dev:pesticide`
3. Navigate to problematic page
4. Share screenshot with outlined elements
5. Identify and fix layout problems

## Troubleshooting

### Pesticide Not Showing
- Check you're in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`)
- Verify environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PESTICIDE=true`
- Look for console messages in browser dev tools
- Ensure CSS file exists at `public/styles/pesticide.dev.css`

### Control Panel Not Visible
- Check for z-index conflicts (Pesticide uses z-index: 9998)
- Verify you're in development environment
- Look for positioning conflicts in your CSS

### Keyboard Shortcut Not Working
- Make sure browser window has focus
- Click on page content first
- Check browser console for key event messages

## Performance Impact

### Development Mode
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minimal Impact**: Small CSS file and React component
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Visual Overhead**: Outlines add visual complexity
- ‚úÖ **Hot Reload**: Compatible with Next.js hot reload
- ‚úÖ **No Build Impact**: Dynamic loading doesn't affect build time

### Production Mode
- ‚úÖ **Zero Impact**: Completely disabled
- ‚úÖ **No Bundle**: Not included in production bundle
