```markdown
## CIRCUIT BREAKER CONDITIONS

If any of these occur, STOP the workflow:
1. Consensus cannot be reached after 6 rounds
2. Implementation causes unexpected breaking changes
3. Rollback procedure fails
4. Business metrics negatively impacted
5. Security vulnerabilities introduced

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURE
1. Immediate rollback to last known good state
2. Document failure point and symptoms
3. Escalate to senior technical lead
4. Conduct root cause analysis
5. Update workflow with lessons learned
