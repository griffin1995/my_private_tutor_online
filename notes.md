## Quick Summary of Key Decisions Needed

*The questions below require your input. Each topic is explained in detail further down with visual examples to help you decide.*

<br>

### **Hero Section & Main Heading**
1. Should the hero section fill the entire screen height when visitors first arrive?
2. Confirm "World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips" as the main headline?

<br>

### **Meet Elizabeth Video Section**
3. Where would you prefer the introduction video to appear?
4. Should we have the video in multiple locations or just one primary spot?

<br>

### **Who We Support Section**
5. Which specific images would you like for each of the seven service categories?

<br>

### **Royal Endorsement**
6. How prominently should the royal endorsement be featured on the homepage?

<br>

### **Client Testimonials**
7. Should we streamline the testimonials section to focus on quality over quantity?

<br>

## HERO SECTION

*This is the first thing visitors see when they arrive on your website. Ignore the current formatting, ie the headings etc.*

<br>

### **Option 1: Full-Screen Hero Section**

Should the hero section fill the entire screen when visitors first arrive? This creates maximum impact but requires users to scroll to see additional content.

**Full-Screen Example:**

<br>

### **Option 2: Partial Hero Section**

Alternatively, we could make it smaller (similar to Ivy Education's approach) so visitors immediately see the school credentials and scrolling university logos below.

**Partial View Example:**

<br>

---

### **Main Heading Confirmation**

You mentioned: *"First heading on this page should be 'World-Class Education, At Your Fingertips'"*

**Just to confirm:** You want this as the large text overlay on the video background in the hero section, correct?

*(The "Founded on trust. Built on results..." text would then appear later in the Elizabeth Burrows introduction section)*

<br>

---

## MEET ELIZABETH VIDEO SECTION

*Where should visitors be able to watch your introduction video?*

<br>

### **Current Situation**

You mentioned: *"Maybe 'Watch Introduction' (please reword to 'Meet Elizabeth') should come under my pic? Rather than at the top of the page"*

<br>

### **Two Possible Approaches:**

<br>

**Option A: Video Only Under Your Photo**
- Remove the video button from the hero section entirely
- Visitors click "Meet Elizabeth" under your photo to watch the introduction
- More streamlined hero section

<br>

**Option B: Video in Both Locations** *(Recommended)*
- Keep video button in hero section for immediate engagement
- Also add "Meet Elizabeth" button under your photo (links to About page)
- Gives visitors multiple ways to learn about you

<br>

**Layout Example:**
*(Your photo would be on the right instead of these white boxes, with a "Meet Elizabeth" button either under your photo, or at the end of the text like in the example)*

<br>

**Which approach do you prefer?**

## WHO WE SUPPORT SECTION

*This section showcases your seven different service categories*

<br>

### **Image Selection Needed**

Could you please specify which images you'd like for each of these seven categories:

1. **Primary School Support**
2. **Secondary School Support** 
3. **Entrance Exam Preparation**
4. **University & Beyond**
5. **Online Homeschooling**
6. **SEN Support**
7. **London In-Person Tutoring**

<br>

*Note: I'll also improve the mobile layout for this section.*

<br>

## ROYAL ENDORSEMENT SECTION

*How prominently should we feature your royal family testimonial?*

*(Again, ignore styling)*

<br>

### **Option A: Large Featured Section**

Make royal endorsement a major focal point by expanding the existing testimonials section:

![alt text](image-4.png)

<br>

### **Option B: Elegant Compact Section** *(Recommended)*

Create a refined, understated section that includes a "Read Testimonials" button, similar to "A Word from Elizabeth" - prominent enough to be noticed but tastefully integrated:

![alt text](image-5.png)

<br>

**Which style better reflects the discretion and prestige you want to convey?**

<br>

---

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

**Status: Removed from Homepage**

This section has been removed from the homepage to avoid duplication, as the content is already covered comprehensively on the dedicated "How It Works" page.

<br>

---

## RESULTS THAT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES

**Status: Being Repositioned**

This section will be moved higher up the page for greater impact. The styling is being updated to work with the new layout.

<br>

---

## TESTIMONIALS SECTION STRATEGY

*Should we streamline the testimonials for maximum impact?*

<br>

### **Recommended Approach:**

**Instead of a large general testimonials section, we suggest:**

- **Highlight the royal endorsement** as your premium testimonial
- **Add a "View All Success Stories" button** that links to your dedicated testimonials page
- **Keep the homepage focused** on the most impactful content

<br>

**This approach:**
- Reduces homepage clutter
- Emphasises your most prestigious testimonial  
- Encourages visitors to explore more testimonials on the dedicated page

<br>

**Do you agree with this streamlined approach?**

<br>

## VIDEO POSITIONING & BUTTON TEXT

*Please help clarify your request about video placement*

<br>

### **Your Request:**

*"Can the video of me introducing MPTO sit higher up and also say something like 'Meet Elizabeth, Here to Help You Succeed'"*

### **Current Status:**

The introduction video is already positioned at the very top of the page (in the Hero section) with a video button.

<br>

### **Could you clarify:**

**Are you referring to:**
- Moving the video button higher within the Hero section itself?
- Adding a different video placement elsewhere on the page?  
- Changing the button text to "Meet Elizabeth, Here to Help You Succeed"?
- Something else entirely?

<br>

**A screenshot or more specific description would help ensure I implement exactly what you have in mind.**

<br>

## LOGO ENHANCEMENT 

### **The Issue:**
The original logo wasn't visible against the video background when the page first loads:

![alt text](image-6.png)

<br>

### **The Solution:**
Created a white version of the logo for better visibility on the hero section:

![alt text](image-8.png)

<br>

### **Smart Transition:**
When visitors scroll down to the white background sections, the logo automatically switches back to the standard version:

![alt text](image-7.png)

<br>

**This ensures optimal visibility and brand consistency throughout the browsing experience.**
